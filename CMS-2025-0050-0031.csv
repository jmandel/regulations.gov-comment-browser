Save yourself some $$ and have us sign up when we are ready to retire. I now have Medicare A as a secondary insurance but our private insurance from work is our primary. Make is simple. Set it up like the Jitterbug phone and not like the iPhone. as we age, we loose our patience so much more easily. we loose our ability to filter our thoughts so we are more easily ticked off for the mandatory need for something that we do not need. As a life long geriatric nurse / MDS coordinator for Medicare reimbursement, I am seeing the other side of this aging coin and why all of those families were so frustrated with your whole system. Just let us sign up for Medicare A and B when we are ready or in need of it. You wonder why your system is overloaded? Unnecessary garbage in it like my Medicare A and B (B that I cancelled. was not paying for that monthly in addition to my private insurance from work!) The fine that is put on the seniors and disabled cause they signed up for Medicare A and or B late, is well over $100 monthly. that is a lot of grocery, medication, or heat resource that they need monthly. Did I say a MONTHLY fine! I actually have had seniors tell me that tuna cat food was cheaper than a brand name for people. Eggs are their main cheap source of protein intake. Thank you for lowering those prices. Medication prices cause them to have cyclic admissions into the hospital and skilled nursing centers as they cannot afford both medications, housing, and food. Housing and food are more important to them. Your Medicare advantage plans are not working as they should. they take away Medicare entitled care and that is what I did. I fought with the advantage plans to get those patients what they earned, what they deserved, what they worked for. Now of retirement age, my plan is to visit senior centers in towns and challenge those advantage plans that to preying on seniors who are alone, vulnerable, possibly cognitively impaired by telling them lies on what their medicare plans offer for them then deny coverage. True story: a friend that lives out of state called me as her mom, who resided in a dementia care unit in a SNF, fell and broke her hip. their medicare advantage plan denied her skilled care and physical therapy due to her dementia. I asked her if she was ambulatory prior to her fall and she was. I directed her to the steps to appeal their decision and they won but....care was a few days delayed. Please, in your technology foundation, make it easy to use. use picture icons if needed. If the patient is on medicare, their spouse / significant other is approximately the same age and as they age into their 80's, their children become of medicare age making it more difficult to manage both generations at the same time. can you consider the use of webinars to educate the patient / responsible party of their rights in place of the hundreds of pages of the medicare manual or even the annual medicare book that I now receive annually. You would be surprised to know that the number of medicare recipients misunderstood that annual book that was sent to them. Again, their aging brain just looses their ability to concentrate and comprehend what you are trying to tell them. some learn better by watching or talking with someone that by reading all of those pages. Make it kid friendly. Again, just let up sign up for medicare A and B when we are ready and make it easier. I had to spend a few hours at social security to verify medicare A of which they said they would need to cancel as I have a HSA being contributed to but they never cancelled. they did cancel part B as I was still working. but all the information I read, we had to sign up at age 65, so I did and I have the cards to prove it should you decide to fine me monthly for signing up late when my husband retires and our private work insurance ends. I have not issues appealing medicare as I have done this for decades for others. ",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

We commend CMS’s efforts to encourage providers, including those in rural areas, to leverage approved digital health products. As the developer of Behaivior Recovery (www.behaivior.com), a predictive digital health platform using wearable devices and designed for behavioral health recovery, we highlight the importance of predictive tools that detect early signals of return-to-use and crisis risk, enabling timely interventions that improve sustained recovery outcomes.

PR-1a:
Current obstacles include lack of reimbursement pathways, limited integration with existing EHR systems, inconsistent interoperability standards across varied data formats, and provider burden related to documentation and workflow disruptions. Rural providers also face infrastructure and staffing limitations.

PR-2:
Development and deployment obstacles include fragmented data standards, lack of standardized APIs supporting full data spectrum (structured and unstructured), and administrative burdens. These could be mitigated by CMS promoting open, standards-based APIs like FHIR, and supporting bulk data access for efficient quality measurement reporting.

PR-3:
Full accessibility of all EHR data formats (including scanned documents, free-text notes, and sensor data) is crucial for comprehensive care. Technical barriers and privacy concerns must be addressed via policy incentives and infrastructure support. The priority of achieving interoperability across all formats should remain high to enable better patient outcomes.

PR-4:
Allowing third-party digital health products secure access to administrative workflows—such as auto-populating intake forms, viewing provider schedules, and managing appointments—can significantly reduce friction in care delivery and improve patient/provider experiences.

PC-1 & PC-3:
Behaivior Recovery (www.behaivior.com/solutions) exemplifies a digital health product supporting individuals and providers across care settings  by leveraging AI and wearable integration to provide predictive health insights. This device-agnostic platform empowers patients, providers, and caregivers to proactively manage mental health and addiction recovery and reduce health crisis risk, such as relapse, aligning with CMS’s goals of improved health outcomes and provider burden reduction.

PC-5:
CMS can encourage adoption through clear and comprehensive reimbursement incentives, education, and reimbursement parity for digital behavioral health tools. 

Wearables and Reimbursement:
Many digital health products, including Behaivior Recovery, rely on data from wearable sensors to detect early physiological and behavioral changes. However, lack of clear reimbursement pathways and coverage policies for wearables remains a significant barrier to provider adoption and patient access. CMS’s leadership in establishing reimbursement frameworks for wearable devices and their integration into clinical care would greatly accelerate the deployment and utility of predictive digital health tools. 

TD-1 & TD-2:
To stimulate developer interest, CMS should expand APIs to include richer data types (e.g., clinical notes, sensor data), enhance API usability, and reduce data access obstacles. Supporting non-CMS data sources that complement claims data can unleash further innovation.

TD-9 & TD-10:
Revising certification criteria to prioritize comprehensive API-enabled data access and consistent data exchange across all patient record elements would reduce provider burden and improve care coordination.

VB-1:
Value-based care models can accelerate digital health adoption by integrating predictive tools like Behaivior Recovery into care pathways, supported by aligned incentives and technical standards.

Summary:
We urge CMS to adopt policies fostering reimbursement, interoperability, provider education, and infrastructure support to unlock the full potential of predictive behavioral health digital tools. These steps will drive improved patient outcomes, lower wasted costs, increase access to care at home, and facilitate value-based care delivery.

Comment Category: Health Information Technology

I am Dr. Niraj Patel, DO MBA, CEO & co-founder of Wavital, a U.S. Class I MDDS platform that streams 300 Hz physiologic waveforms and continuous vitals from multi-vendor bedside monitors into Bulk FHIR pipelines in real time. Each patient-day yields ~26 million data points that can avert ICU transfers, but today zero of them flow through CMS-mandated APIs. I appreciate the chance to comment on the Health Technology Ecosystem RFI.

CMS and ONC should unlock bedside data, stop warranty-based information blocking, and create a voluntary AI-safety label. These actions will reduce nurse workload, lower VBP/HRRP penalties, and catalyze safer AI at the bedside, especially for rural hospitals.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. USCDI-Vitals = Add continuous waveforms & ≥1 Hz vitals to USCDI and TEFCA by CY 2027, using IEEE 11073 terminology & HL7 v2 MDM. [TD-7, PC-10]  
2. IEEE 11073 SDC transport = Require basic SDC “plug-and-trust” discovery/time-sync in the 2028 CEHRT update to eliminate vendor-proprietary serial links. [TD-4, PR-5]  
3. Bulk FHIR sandbox = Fund a pilot that posts de-identified streaming vitals + claims (“Physiology-at-Scale”) for AI/ML R&D. [TD-15, VB-3]  
4. Clinical AI Safety Label = Add a voluntary ONC certification track with provenance metadata, model-version logging, and drift reporting. [TD-8, TD-10]  
5. Alert endpoints = Tie the 2024 Provider-Access API rule to alert channels so Shock-Index>1 can hit the EHR inbox with one-click acknowledgement. [PR-4]  
6. DRG-neutral add-on = Create a payment add-on for continuous physiologic surveillance (analogous to EEG/tele-ICU) to fund MDDS-level streaming + validated AI CDS. [VB-1, PA-5]  
7. Ban license-tying warranties = Declare OEM clauses that void warranty or demand “unlock-fees” for raw data as *per se* information blocking under PHSA §3022(a)(1); add a “warranty-neutral data access” attestation to CEHRT and coordinate with FTC on Section 5 enforcement. [TD-4, TD-18(a)]

WHY THIS MATTERS:
- Clinical impact = Deep-learning early-warning systems using high-resolution data reach AUROC 0.86 vs 0.68 for MEWS and cut alarm counts > 50 % (Cho 2020; Pimentel 2021).  
- Economic impact = A 500-bed hospital can save \$12–24 M over 5 years in VBP/HRRP penalties; OEM “unlock-keys” cost up to \$8 k/bed/yr today.  
- Feasibility = Wavital plans to normalize > 40 proprietary packet formats, bridges IEEE 11073 SDC to Bulk FHIR NDJSON, and tracks model lineage; proof that all seven recommendations are technically achievable without new bedside hardware.

REQUEST:
Please (1) incorporate these seven items in the forthcoming proposed rule, (2) list warranty-based data blocking as a high-priority OIG enforcement example, and (3) convene a real-time data sub-workgroup under the Digital Health Policy Committee.

Respectfully submitted,

Niraj Patel, DO MBA

Submitted by: Matthew Ingalls, Founder & CEO, One & Done Smart Bids
Date: May 16th, 2025
File Code: CMS-0042-NC

One & Done Smart Bids is a patent-pending platform optimizing Medicare Advantage (MA) plan selection, saving $104 billion annually for 35.7 million enrollees ($2,922 average per MA plan annually; $3,846 per MA-PD plan annually). We thank CMS and ASTP/ONC for this RFI and offer insights to advance a patient-centric digital health ecosystem, aligning with CMMI’s value-based care (VBC) goals.

PC-1, PC-4: Health Management Apps
One & Done Smart Bids empowers seniors with one-click plan optimization, analyzing claims and health data to recommend plans saving $3,846 annually for MA-PD enrollees ($2,922 overall MA average). Its patent-pending technology enables real-time cost comparisons and care navigation integration, features absent in current apps. CMS could enable these via standardized MA data APIs.

PC-5, TD-1: Encouraging Adoption
We propose a no-cost CMMI pilot to test One & Done Smart Bids, building on 117,100 scenarios showing $3,846 annual savings for MA-PD enrollees. CMS could certify apps for efficacy (e.g., consumer savings, user satisfaction) and promote them via Medicare.gov. A 7-minute video demo https://youtu.be/18aNziPgBps showcases our interface and savings.

PC-6: Accessibility
Our one-click interface, jargon-free onboarding, and auto-reshopping ensure seniors reach results in <2 minutes, ideal for low-tech users.

PC-9, TD-2: Blue Button 2.0 Enhancements
Expand Blue Button 2.0 to include:
Real-time MA claims and health data (for plan optimization).
Dental, vision, hearing, and formulary details.
Social determinants of health.
Delays and proprietary payer APIs hinder access; CMS could mandate FHIR-based APIs via TEFCA.

PC-12: Competition Use Cases
One & Done Smart Bids enhances beneficiary choice by optimizing cost-effective MA plans, modestly diversifying insurer selection (e.g., UnitedHealthcare 25.95% vs. ~29% market share, Wellcare 19.17% vs. ~12%) and including smaller insurers (e.g., Devoted Health, 1.40%). It does not favor regional plans (0.05% Regional PPO). CMS could support choice via provider directories with FHIR endpoints (PA-4), enabling better plan-provider matching.

TD-18: Information Blocking
Payer delays in sharing MA claims and health data (e.g., 6-month lags) limit plan optimization. CMS should enforce real-time sharing and penalize non-compliance.

VB-1, VB-4: VBC Incentives
Incentivize Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) in the Medicare Shared Savings Program to adopt One & Done Smart Bids via shared savings bonuses, leveraging its risk stratification and $104B annual savings. Its plan selections (30% HMO, 12% SNP) align with ACOs’ coordinated care models, enhancing cost efficiency and quality. Real-time claims and health data are critical for VBC success.

Conclusion
One & Done Smart Bids, with its patent-pending technology, aligns with CMS’s cost reduction, choice, and patient empowerment goals. We seek a CMMI pilot to scale our impact.

While digital health technologies offer significant benefits, it's crucial to recognize that many seniors face challenges in adopting these tools. Factors such as limited digital literacy, cognitive impairments, and physical disabilities can hinder their ability to effectively use health technologies. To ensure equitable access, CMS should consider:
- Implementing user-friendly interfaces tailored for seniors
- Providing training programs to enhance digital literacy
- Ensuring availability of alternative support channels, such as telephonic assistance
Additionally, I recommend establishing a test group that includes both seniors and younger individuals, alongside medical staff, to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of health technology applications. This diverse testing group can provide valuable feedback on real-world functionality, accessibility, and clarity. Ensuring input from people who actually use and support these tools will improve design, reduce frustration, and increase adoption.
2. Shortage of Endocrinologists and Diabetes Nurse Educators
The increasing prevalence of diabetes among the aging population underscores the need for specialized care. However, there's a notable shortage of endocrinologists and diabetes nurse educators, which can impede effective disease management. CMS might explore:
- Incentivizing training programs to increase the workforce in these specialties
- Leveraging telehealth to extend the reach of existing specialists
- Integrating community health workers to provide localized support
3. Enhancing Access to Health Records
Empowering patients with access to their health records is a commendable step. However, without adequate professional support, interpreting and acting upon this information can be challenging for many seniors. To bridge this gap:
- CMS could support the development of tools that translate complex medical data into understandable insights
- Facilitate collaborations between patients and care coordinators to interpret health information effectively
As someone living with Type 1 Diabetes for nearly 70 years, I am acutely aware of how vital it is to have access to accurate, up-to-date health records. I currently use multiple health record applications, which can become confusing—especially when different practices use different platforms. That said, I want to commend Trinity Health for doing an excellent job with integrating and maintaining my records.
I’d also like to suggest a cost-saving improvement for Medicare: discontinue the routine requirement for redundant blood tests to reconfirm a long-established Type 1 Diabetes diagnosis during the transition to Medicare. These tests increase costs without offering any additional clinical benefit, especially for individuals who have managed T1D for decades. Medicare could instead reference the individual's pre-existing medical records, which often clearly document the diagnosis well before they become a Medicare primary recipient.
This would also help hospitals and nursing homes quickly determine whether someone has Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes and whether they are insulin-dependent, so that adherence to ADA guidelines for treatment can be addressed and improved.
4. Preparing for the Needs of the Baby Boomer Generation
The Baby Boomer generation is entering a phase where chronic conditions become more prevalent. To meet their healthcare needs:
- CMS should consider expanding programs that focus on chronic disease management
- Invest in preventive care initiatives to reduce the onset of chronic conditions
- Encourage the development of technologies that support aging in place
In conclusion, while technology holds promise for enhancing healthcare delivery, it's essential to ensure that solutions are inclusive, accessible, and supported by a robust healthcare workforce.

Thank you for considering these perspectives.

Entrepreneur: One who organizes, manages, and assumes the risks of a business or enterprise, often with an additional connotation of far-sightedness and innovation with boldness and energy.
[French, from Old French, from entreprendre to undertake; entre- between  (from Latin: inter-) + prendre to take (from Latin: prehendere to grasp)]

The U.S. government funded training for substance abuse researchers in entrepreneurship at Yale, so they could learn how to get more funding for their health care startups about substance abuse.

Scholarly articles have been published about ""The Psychology of Entrepreneurship"". One such study we noticed focused on industrial and organizational psychology (it has its own abbreviation, I/O); many of its key conclusions were to plead for more research in that area. We think that one of the primary goals of this kind of psychobabble is to set the stage for getting more research funds, rather than coming up with anything truly useful.

Another news article in the Washington Post ""noticed that entrepreneurs seem inclined to have mental health issues."" There are any number of news reports about ""the problems entrepreneurs with mental illness often face,"" and ""managing your mental health as an entrepreneur,"" and yet again ""the psychological price of entrepreneurship.""

So it seems that psychiatry and psychology have latched onto entrepreneurs as a new category of those needing ""help,"" a new pool of potential customers. Entrepreneurs have been targeted by the mental health industry both as a new customer pool and a new way to do business. The competition for government funding and grants to address the problems of entrepreneurship is heating up, and the psychobabble is deafening.

Research also confirms that minorities are more likely to be misdiagnosed as having serious psychiatric problems, leading to the psychiatric targeting of  entrepreneurial minorities. 

And, like any entrepreneur, psychiatrists are looking to the future. Since they have never been required to cure anyone, they continually come up with new disorders, new drugs, and new treatments which they can apply to new communities of potential patients.

The news is full of these ""miracle"" treatments -- marijuana, cannabidiol, electric shock (yes, they still do this, and it is a big money-maker), MDMA (Ecstasy), trauma-informed therapy, Ketamine, cognitive-behavioral therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, assisted suicide (yes, this is considered a ""treatment""), deep brain stimulation, involuntary commitment, vagus nerve stimulation, addiction therapy (ignoring the fact that psychiatric drugs are addictive), and one drug after another -- each new one designed to combat the adverse side effects of the one before.

Not to mention the profusion of new mental health related applications for your mobile device and the startups that create these. Not to mention this recent headline: ""Entrepreneur Teams Up with Leading Psychiatrist to Address Depression, Anxiety, and Suicide"". Not to mention that the producers of ""Shark Tank"" mandated that ""all entrepreneurs meet with a psychiatrist after giving their pitch, regardless of the outcome.""

The news is devoid, however, of one thing -- actual cures for mental trauma.

For our small home care agency in Iowa the cost of the EMR is very expensive approximately 20% of my revenue is spent on software license and support.  Imagine if CMS Provided one EMR for all Provider Types.  One patient may have 4 different doctors, two different hospital or clinic systems, a pharmacy, and Medicare, Medicaid and VA benefits.  Imagine the improved care outcomes and decrease in hospitalization we would have if all Clinicians had the ""whole"" picture and we ""all"" had the same data.  No matter where the patient is served we all have the entire medication list and the full list of diagnosis.  Imagine how much money we could save if we were not running duplicate lab tests.  HIPPA can be maintained by the patient who would grant access with a temporary 6 digit pin given to a provider (access granted for one year and at admission and discharge).  Reports could show who had access to information.  Clinicians could work together messaging within the system.  Clinician's getting timely physician orders and pharmacy getting meds to the patient faster.  Requesting authorization for services would be streamlined because the payer would have direct access to all clinical data with out waiting for documentation (also opening up for data breech sharing information this way).  Imagine if CMS wanted to use AI to complete audits for fraud, waste and abuse.  CMS can do desk audits before going on site to a facility.  Providers could focus on actual care instead of all the duplicate data coming in from all different provider types.  OASIS, MDS, QAPI data would all be available to CMS with out requesting information.  Claims could be paid easily or recouped with the use of AI.  This would streamline data and provide efficiencies.  This would put clinicians back at the bed side.  All the extra data that we are gathering and paper pushing has just pulled talented positions into ""DATA Management"" roles.  One EMR managed by CMS would provide huge cost savings, streamline, and provide so much better outcomes for patients.  And the efficiencies with streamlining would also increase early response to issues that would result in decreasing ER visits and hospitalization.  If you would like to discuss more information.  I can be reached at dtaylorfhhc@gmail.com - let's cut the red tape, cut the cost, and streamline care its the year 2025 and we are still exchanging data at a snail speed.

With reimbursements down, it is getting harder to purchase the tech solutions.

This request is not only ethically urgent—it is technically feasible and fully aligned with the capabilities of the FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard already adopted across the U.S. healthcare ecosystem.

Under the HL7 FHIR specification, the AuditEvent resource is explicitly designed to capture detailed information about access to protected health information (PHI), including the identity of the user, the action taken, the timestamp, and the purpose of access. This functionality is already a required component of internal logging for most health systems. However, while FHIR-compliant APIs are mandated under the 21st Century Cures Act and the ONC’s 2020 Cures Act Final Rule for patient-facing access to clinical data, no such requirement exists for exposing AuditEvent resources to patients themselves.

This is a critical shortcoming. In my own experience, despite being the subject of the record, I was denied meaningful access to audit logs when I requested information about who had viewed my file. I have also personally witnessed healthcare professionals—family members and friends—speak casually about accessing patient records out of curiosity, social interest, or personal bias, with no expectation of consequences. The lack of transparency makes such behavior difficult to detect, let alone deter or penalize.

The infrastructure exists. The FHIR AuditEvent standard provides a structured, interoperable format that could be exposed to patients through the same APIs currently used to access clinical notes, medications, and test results. What is missing is the regulatory requirement and enforcement mechanism to do so.

I therefore urge CMS and ONC to go further than current policy by explicitly requiring:

1. Patient-facing access to FHIR AuditEvent logs via the same API and portal systems used for accessing USCDI data elements.

2.Standardized labeling of access reasons (e.g., treatment, billing, quality review) using the AuditEvent.purposeOfEvent field, with defaults defined for national consistency.

3. Notification systems that alert patients to unusual or high-risk access, modeled after tools used in the financial services industry.

4. Time-bound response mandates for health systems to respond to audit log requests, just as they must with record requests under HIPAA.

These reforms would not only bring EHR systems into full compliance with the spirit of the Cures Act—they would also operationalize patient-centered care, strengthen data integrity, and rebuild public trust in healthcare institutions. HIPAA grants patients the right to access their health information; it is time to extend that principle to the metadata that tells them who is viewing it.

This is a rare case where the technical standard (FHIR) is already ahead of policy. Now the regulation must catch up.

I never set out to fix healthcare—I just wanted to survive it. But like too many patients, I was misdiagnosed, delayed, and dismissed—because the system was too fragmented to see the full picture. What should have been a simple pharmacogenomic test became a years-long journey through silos, policy gaps, and out-of-pocket costs. That experience nearly broke me—but it also gave me purpose.

My submission calls for the creation of a National Safe Harbor for Real-World Interoperability Testing—not as another pilot, but as permanent infrastructure to validate the connections that patients, providers, and pharmacists actually depend on: PGx, ePA, RTBC, DTx, and pharmacy-centered workflows. I believe we need to stop asking patients to stitch their care together—and start building a system that’s unified by design.

I’ve included supporting materials, including a pharmacy interoperability white paper, a precision medicine executive summary I coauthored, and personal commentaries on data access, trust, and patient equity. These aren’t theoretical papers—they reflect lived challenges and the real cost of inaction.

My goal isn’t to critique what’s been done—it’s to urge us to do better. To center patients, include pharmacy, and align health tech with outcomes, not optics. Because people aren’t dying from lack of technology—they’re dying from a lack of connection.

I heard about proposed idea changes for the future to Medicare and wanted to share some comments and opinion. I do feel that that proposed idea regarding prevention of disease has always been a good idea. Truth is dispensing accurate and full information regarding disease prevention and essential tools for maintaining good health would be foremost what is needed since there is conflicting information coming from healthcare industry vs natural healing methods. Food, and definitely a new food pyramid, and educating regarding things Seniors can do to extend their lives using and exploring food and natural herbs as preventative medicine and encouraging programs for exercise is a good idea. Getting the processed food, chemicals, and especially the glyphosates and corn syrup out of the food supply is a good start, so is limiting salt and sugar in foods being sold. Also, Telehealth is the future of Healthcare and very necessary to Disabled, Elderly and those that live in Rural Areas without Transportation. Speaking of which, can we please see that health plans support those who need it with Transportation to their medical appointments, as is being done for Medicaid? This is absolutely ESSENTIAL for Seniors and Disabled who have little to no access to Transportation for good care. Keeping the price of OTC and prescription items affordable are a good start. And added incentives for fulfilling good health prevention and maintenance are also a good idea to potentially keep healthcare costs lower across the board in the long-term. And also, what about exploring the ability to use Naturopathic and Homeopathic medical care in order to keep people healthy not just physically, but holistically, in body, mind and spirit instead of hoping to stick a band-aid on cures, lets get down to the whole system and find out what is causing the disease, not just mask symptoms? For instance, many things begin in the mind and manifest in the body. I think its time we embrace WHOLENESS in general, within our own systems by integrating and promoting body, mind and spirit wholeness, and in our institutions of society in general. Humanity should be healthier, smarter and farther in evolutionary progress, but all of our institutions and progress in languishing. It's time to go beyond what manifests in the physical and look to initial causes and how we can better prevent breakdown across all areas of the system.

That's the frustrating, fragmented and insecure “human solution"" to the overwhelming deluge of health information that was supposedly solved through thousands of siloed patient portals and decades of non-portable personal health records.  We have more access to care than ever in our lives, but we’re crushing consumers with the weight of managing it.  Twenty years ago, most of us had a primary care doctor, a hospital and a local pharmacy.  Today, we have telemedicine, urgent care, psychiatrists, psychologists, digital solutions for musculoskeletal, gastroenterological and other needs, acupuncture, pain management and so much more.  And the ONLY place all of that information comes together is with the human at the center of that journey – or the loved one who is managing that information.  We’ve become the general contractors of our own bodies but have none of the tools for the job.  Our healthcare system has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on health technology for the practitioners and the consumer has a smart phone, a portal and a three-ring binder.   It’s time to tip the scales and get that consumer – and their chosen family and friends – the right information at the right place at the right time.  Health is a team sport and siloed, one-to-one solutions don’t solve the problem of the individual – whether that’s the caregiver or care recipient – of needing available, understandable and actionable information all in one place to be better consumers of healthcare and more impactful advocates for the people we care FOR and ABOUT.    The name of our company is Kith + Kin (an old-fashioned term for friends and family) and our app is the KinKeeper (because most people don’t refer to themselves as caregivers).  A KinKeeper is the person playing air traffic control for all the appointments and reminders and central intelligence, making sure everyone knows what they need to know – when they need to know it.  Those KinKeepers are the lynchpin to all of the care that happens outside the walls of a traditional healthcare delivery model and are critical to the long-term health of the people they’re caring for.  And whether we’re managing health information for ourselves or others, we need to be able to import, organize, manage and share WHAT we want, WITH WHOM we want, WHEN we want – at our fingertips and in our control.  That’s why we exist and why we’re thrilled that CMS is  looking at this through the lens of a consumer market and through the eyes of an individual who needs a way to take back some control of a situation that often feels anything BUT.  We look forward to responding to the RFP.

Brief info about the iPill : 

iPill addresses the lack of medication adherence as an FDA Class II breakthrough designated product.  

iPill animation  https://docsend.com/view/5afanwprd49jixdt

iPill deck https://docsend.com/view/7t5vhu37ic4tw2se

Problem
The end-user dispensing pharmacy and end-user prescribing physician have endless regulations to follow when prescribing opioids, but the final user patient has no rules or regulations at home and can easily misuse, divert, actually overdose on the opioid they are prescribed. 

That is the reason 75% of patients don’t take their prescribed medications correctly which results in 125,000 deaths annually and $290 billion per year in additional healthcare expenditures because of higher rates of hospital admissions, suboptimal health outcomes, and higher morbidity/mortality for chronic conditions.
 
With opioids, opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose death can occur.  In 2023, there were 110,000 opioid overdose deaths at a cost of $2.7 trillion in medical expenses, unemployment, homelessness and crime.   We have medications to treat OUD and reduce opioid overdose deaths by 50% but only 11% of patients can get these medications due to significant barriers to access care, including lack of transportation, lack of childcare, lack of healthcare literacy, stigma, healthcare inequities, geographical disparities, health disparities, and reduction of social determinants of health. 

Each overdose death costs $24.545 million.  ($2.7 trillion/110,000)

Solution 
iPill technology brings holistic care to patients with pill and patient monitoring.  

iPill provides : 
    * secure home delivery and storage 
    * biometric precise dispensing of medications only to the prescription 
       holder at only the prescribed schedule.
    * destruction of unused pills at 30 days and immediately if tampered
    * remote medication adherence monitoring to detect/remediate missed daily doses
    * notification alerts to family, friends, and caregivers for missed doses,
    * data Integration sync with Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and Superscripts 
    * capture of vital signs via faceprint AI 
    * psychosocial support via telehealth

Need
There is an immediate need for the iPill to increase patient access to treatment.  iPill’s versatility stems from the ability to securely and precisely dispense medications of varying shapes and sizes so opioids, opioid use disorder medications, sedatives, stimulants, tranquilizers, HIV drugs, specialty, and oncologic drugs can be used in the iPill dispenser.

65% of the jail population has OUD.  The detainees are not treated for OUD in jail and after release, have a 129 times higher chance of overdose death in the 2 weeks after release, a 75% higher risk of relapse, a 75% higher risk of recidivism, and a 50% chance of re-incarceration.  iPill could be made a mandatory part of early parole requiring 12 months of continuous treatment at an OUD clinic, Paid for with opioid litigation settlement funds and reimbursement from remote patient monitoring code remote therapeutic monitoring codes, iPill could improve treatment retention, reduce relapse, and save money and and lives.  

In the Veterans administration, there are 208 OUD clinics in the VA system treating 6,500 vets but 418,000 American Veterans need treatment but are unable to get treatment.  The result has been 44 veterans dying a day from suicide and overdoses.  iPill could be used to securely delivery, store, and dispense medications and deliver care with a virtual doctor and nurse in their homes.  iPill could be used to save veterans lives.","Association - Device",,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2025-0050-0051/attachment_1.pdf","pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

We applaud HHS for advancing digital health and interoperability. As a technology-enabled care management provider, CareAtlas sees firsthand the opportunity to transform Medicare beneficiary care—especially by integrating nutrition, sleep, diet, and mental health into digital care models.
CareAtlas helps keep patients “Healthy and Happy at Home” by partnering with providers to deliver Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) and Chronic Care Management (CCM). We use home devices for real-time tracking, provide regular check-ins, medication reminders, diet and lifestyle coaching, and coordinate care to reduce hospitalizations and support independent living. Our team-based approach ensures patients, doctors, and caregivers stay connected between visits⁠
⁠⁠
⁠.
Despite clear benefits, current digital health infrastructure and reimbursement are not sufficient to support robust, evidence-based services in nutrition, sleep, and mental health. While CareAtlas offers basic diet and lifestyle support, policy and technology barriers limit our ability to deliver comprehensive nutrition interventions. The same is true for sleep and behavioral health—critical domains for chronic disease prevention and management that are not yet fully integrated into Medicare digital health workflows⁠
⁠.
We urge CMS and ASTP/ONC to:
Expand Medicare coverage and demonstration projects for virtual nutrition, sleep, and mental health services, including preventive coaching.
Prioritize these domains in USCDI and FHIR standards, enabling seamless integration with care management platforms⁠
⁠.
Incentivize digital tools that bridge clinical care with daily health behaviors, and ensure accessibility for older adults and underserved populations.
Fund research and pilots to evaluate the impact of integrated services on outcomes and costs, and streamline regulatory pathways for innovative digital health products⁠
⁠.
CareAtlas stands ready to be a catalyst for this next phase of patient-centered care. We urge HHS to prioritize investment and standards development in nutrition, sleep, diet, and mental health, enabling digital health companies to deliver whole-person care for Medicare beneficiaries.

I commend CMS for its forward-thinking approach to modernizing digital health infrastructure and promoting equitable access to innovation. I would like to offer comments on two critical areas: Innovation and Reimbursement, and Digital Divide and Health Equity.
1. Innovation and Reimbursement
While the digital health sector is rapidly evolving, reimbursement models have not kept pace with the innovation landscape. Many promising technologies—such as remote monitoring tools, AI-driven diagnostics, and digital therapeutics—face significant barriers to adoption due to unclear or inconsistent reimbursement pathways.
Recommendations:
	• Establish clear, scalable reimbursement frameworks for digital health tools that demonstrate clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness.
	• Expand coverage with evidence development (CED) models to support emerging technologies while data is being collected.
	• Encourage value-based payment models that reward outcomes achieved through digital interventions, not just traditional in-person care.
Without these changes, innovators may be discouraged from developing tools for Medicare populations, and providers may hesitate to adopt them due to financial uncertainty.
2. Digital Divide and Health Equity
The promise of digital health will remain unfulfilled if it does not reach the populations who need it most. Many Medicare beneficiaries—particularly those in rural areas, low-income households, or with limited digital literacy—face barriers to accessing and using health technologies.
Recommendations:
	• Invest in broadband infrastructure and device access for underserved communities.
	• Support digital literacy programs tailored to older adults and caregivers.
	• Require that CMS-funded digital tools meet accessibility and usability standards for diverse populations, including those with disabilities or limited English proficiency.
Equity must be a foundational principle in the design and deployment of digital health solutions. Otherwise, we risk widening existing disparities in care and outcomes.

Thank you for your leadership in shaping a more inclusive, innovative, and patient-centered health technology ecosystem. I look forward to seeing how CMS incorporates public input into future policy development.

You’ve asked the right question.

How can CMS evolve policy to meet the realities of modern healthcare delivery, particularly where digital infrastructure is no longer auxiliary, but foundational?

Out of the multitude we should consider, here’s one clear opportunity:

Reimburse Distributed Clinical Logic.

Across the system today, we’re seeing software (not people) making real-time decisions that directly impact care:

• Routing a patient from surgery to physical therapy
• Escalating behavioral risk based on pattern decompensation
• Titrating medication timing based on dynamic context
• Detecting social need and auto-triggering intervention

These aren’t administrative workflows.
They’re clinical decisions, executed with speed, consistency, and scalability no human can match.

Unfortunately, none of this is billable.

Not under FFS. Not under most APMs. Not under most value-based tech carveouts.

As a result, systems that think, that coordinate, escalate, and guide care with clinical-grade intelligence are treated as cost centers. 

And not because they lack value, but because the reimbursement system doesn’t yet recognize intelligence as infrastructure.

I’m proposing that it should.

What is Distributed Clinical Logic (DCL)?

It’s a framework for understanding how real-time, rule-based or AI-enabled decision engines guide care delivery across the system.

Not in one place, but everywhere care happens.
Not with one person, but as a persistent, embedded substrate of coordination.

It is:

• Deterministic when it needs to be
• Probabilistic when it must be
• Clinically governed always

It doesn’t replace clinicians.
It frees them from what doesn’t require their expertise, so they can focus on where it does.

And it scales quality.

⸻

Why Now?

Because this logic is already here, inside RPM dashboards, prior auth platforms, population health tools, and care management engines.

But none of it’s incentivized the right way.
And the opportunity cost of not acting is enormous.

I believe CMS could lead the industry in reframing this layernot as “tech,” not as “admin,” but as billable, clinical infrastructure.

A subtle change in definition. A massive shift in what becomes possible.

I have a  proposed framework for how this model could work. Including use cases, reimbursement structures, stakeholder benefits, and implementation tiers.

I welcome the opportunity to collaborate further.

With respect and urgency,

I suggest that your quest for an interoperable infrastructure be a value-added proposition for all stakeholders. 

A healthy lifestyle is recognized as the bedrock for managing almost every serious chronic medical condition. Yet, it is sparsely adopted by patients and poorly taught by providers. There is a ready solution that would also serve your infrastructure quest. 

Almost every senior uses a smartphone. Offer all a credible and effective lifestyle coaching mobile app as a free download from Medicare. Daily, sensible, delightful, updated, science-based prompts, nudges, microsteps, and information nuggets will do what sporadic clinic visits can never achieve. Seniors and providers alike would welcome it because they know they need it. 

Medicare can contract with vetted healthcare entities that offer such a healthcare mobile app on the condition that the patients’ health information on it is transmitted to a Medicare data bank.  

With confidentiality ensured by Medicare, such a mobile app can track seniors’ biometrics, such as weight, blood pressure, pulse rate, exercise times, sleep patterns, and others. This bio-info bank is invaluable for Medicare’s public health purposes and any healthcare system’s planning. 

One such health management application already in use is the “Metacardio Healing Habits” app. But there must be others. I welcome Medicare or its designated healthcare enterprises to adopt my Metacardio lifestyle coaching app. With relatively minor modifications, this iOS app can be developed into a personal health record tracker that is interoperable across the entire ecosystem. 

I will not charge Medicare any fees. I only want to be of service as a retiring medical professional. For more information, please visit www.metacardio.org, my non-monetized website.

The peoples health identifiable information should and must stay private. Under no circumstance should it be shared with any party without the consent of the individual this information need to be able to be audited by the individual as well. For example if a patient uses their visa atm card to pay a co-pay under no circumstance should the Dr. office be sharing anything with visa or experian/tranunion etc or anyone. Another example: If records for a specialty doctor are needed only the specialist should be provided the info and ONLY after the patient has authorized the disclosure.

I am a caregiver for my 87 year old mother, who moved from her home to assisted living in November 2024. I am also the Director of Health Information for a residential special hospital in NJ. It has been quite a task to gather and share my mother's medical records, as not all providers use Epic in their practices. For those who do, I have set up sharing to enhance the exchange of information. My mother, having dementia, cannot navigate the use of MyChart, and has never used it even before she was diagnosed.

I see a tremendous gap in communication with the assited living facility, which does not seem to have an EMR that is able to be shared with families/caregivers. There is also a gap in practice because I, as someone in the HIM field for 40+ years, note that the agency does have someone knowledgable about patient registration and the importance of sharing accurate information across the care continuum. For example, my mother's facesheet lists 3 primary care physicians, one of whom was apparently assigned by the rehab facility without conversation with her or me. i have asked more than once for a correction, to remove those who are not her primary from that facesheet.

Prescriptions for medications have gotten lost along the way between transfers from acute care to rehab to ALU. Even with my knowledge and experience, it's been difficult to get that straightened out, so I see the challenge for those with less knowledge and patience.

As policymakers consider moving from annual to semi-annual redeterminations, we see an urgent need to replace outdated, paper-based processes with automated, AI-enhanced, digital-first solutions that leverage existing infrastructure and commercial innovations.

Policy Recommendations: Make Renewal Smarter, Not Just More Frequent
1. Fund automation and AI-driven renewal workflows

CMS should encourage and fund solutions that:
•	Auto-populate renewal forms with existing eligibility data (e.g., SNAP, 
        TANF, SSA);
•	Use AI to guide users through complex renewal questions in plain 
        language;
•	Deploy intelligent reminders via SMS, email, or app notification;
•	Flag incomplete renewals in real-time and nudge users with next steps.

AI-enabled digital assistants can reduce error rates, minimize friction, and support beneficiaries with low literacy or limited tech experience—at scale.

2. Leverage and extend existing infrastructure investments

CMS and states have already invested heavily in Medicaid Enterprise Systems (MES), the Federal Data Services Hub, and Blue Button 2.0. CMS should:

•	Provide integration standards and reusable APIs for digital renewals;
•	Incentivize states to build renewal tools that plug into existing 
        eligibility engines;
•	Promote platform-agnostic architectures that can scale across states.

Let’s stop reinventing the wheel. Use what’s already built—and make it smarter.

3. Promote interoperability with commercial digital products

Digital health shouldn’t start from scratch. CMS should identify leading-edge commercial products—think mobile apps, identity credentialing platforms, chatbot frameworks—and encourage states to partner with them, not compete against them.

•	These tools are already HIPAA-compliant, user-tested, and cloud-native.
•	Open standards like FHIR and SMART on FHIR can facilitate secure data 
        exchange and integration.
•	CMS can curate a list of pre-qualified vendors and reusable components to 
        streamline procurement.

4. Support equity with a ""Digital Participation Fund""

As we digitize, we must not leave vulnerable communities behind. CMS should create a competitive grant program for states to:

•	Provide mobile-friendly renewal support in multiple languages;
•	Ensure compatibility with assistive technologies;
•	Offer public-private partnerships for mobile data subsidies, broadband, 
        and device access.

Access isn’t just about the software—it’s about getting the software into people’s hands.

5. Quantify the cost of inaction

To strengthen the policy case, CMS should analyze and publish the national cost of paper-based redeterminations—factoring in printing, postage, returned mail, call center volume, and avoidable churn. Model this against the cost of deploying scalable digital tools.

We suspect the return on investment will be clear and compelling.

Final Word

Administrative churn is not an inevitable cost of doing business—it’s a fixable policy failure. CMS has the authority, tools, and partners to lead a transition from legacy mailing cycles to automated, intelligent, digital renewal systems that reduce waste and improve access to care.

Let’s treat this not as a technology problem, but as an equity and efficiency opportunity.

In my opinion, the most efficient way to streamline both the process, and the cost associated with Medicare and Medicaid, is leverage technologies so that both physicians and mid levels from a primary care point more freedom. 

The technology exist, and in fact, has been approved for Medicare and Medicaid. It just needs wider deployment. It is being used in countless regions and multiple friends of mine have had rave

Here is the Copilot response 

You're referring to ECG as Electronic Care Givers, not electrocardiograms. One of the most advanced and widely recognized systems in this space is Addison Care by Electronic Caregiver, which has been making significant strides in home healthcare.

 Addison Care – AI-Powered Electronic Caregiver (ECG)
Addison Care is a 3D virtual caregiver designed to provide round-the-clock home care using AI and avatar technology. It was showcased at HIMSS 2025 in partnership with Samsung.
Key Features:
3D Avatar Interface: A lifelike, interactive virtual caregiver that communicates with users in a friendly, engaging way.
Vitals Monitoring: Integrates with devices like the Samsung Galaxy Watch7 to track heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels, and more.
Medication Management: Provides reminders, tracks adherence, and alerts caregivers if doses are missed.
24/7 Emergency Response: Offers instant access to emergency services and virtual physician consultations.
Mental & Physical Health Support: Includes guided fitness routines, physical therapy, cognitive exercises, and emotional support to combat loneliness and depression.
Cognitive Assistance: Helps users with memory, focus, and daily routines—especially beneficial for seniors or those with cognitive decline.
Early Detection & Preventative Care: Uses AI to monitor health trends and alert users or providers to potential issues before they escalate.
-How It Works at Home:
Installed on Samsung tablets, smart TVs, or mobile devices.
Uses voice and visual interaction to engage users.
Syncs with smart home ecosystems for seamless integration.
This system is especially valuable for:

Seniors living alone
Individuals with chronic conditions
Family caregivers needing remote support

I would recommend this solution. It is awesome and they have on call medical staff if needed.  Electronic Caregiver (ECG) is the way to go. We as a nation have to start somewhere that will help everyone save money and resources, why not start with what appears and has shown to be the best.

To whom it may concern:

We at CNMIGA.ORG are submitting this comment in response to the Request for Information (RFI) CMS-0042-NC regarding digital health products, interoperability, and patient data access.

We urgently raise a matter of national and ethical concern in the U.S. territory of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), specifically regarding operations at the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation (CHCC), located at 1178 Hinemlu Street, Garapan, Saipan, MP 96950.

Over 90% of CHCC’s medical staff are foreign nationals/non-American citizens. While we support workforce diversity and international expertise, we cannot ignore the alarming frequency of reported medical malpractice incidents and documented instances of identity theft. These incidents threaten not only patient safety but also national data integrity, especially given the sensitive health data managed under HIPAA protections.

In light of these systemic issues, CNMIGA.ORG urgently calls for the following mandatory safeguards to be adopted into CMS and ONC rulemaking and enforced at all medical facilities, especially those operating in U.S. territories:

https://www.cnmiga.org/post/chcc-grand-larceny-and-medical-malpractice-in-the-marianas-a-clarion-call-for-america-first-actio

Absolute Protection of HIPAA Data:

No non-American citizens should be granted access to protected health information (PHI), unless they are U.S.-licensed and bonded professionals with malpractice insurance and subject to U.S. HIPAA enforcement jurisdiction. This applies equally to third-party software vendors, translators, medical assistants, and foreign-trained doctors.

Mandated Medical Malpractice and Liability Insurance Coverage:

All healthcare facilities—particularly those relying on foreign labor—must be required to carry U.S.-regulated malpractice and liability insurance. This requirement must be universal, with no exceptions, to ensure accountability in cases of malpractice, fraud, or data breaches.

Given CMS’s increasing emphasis on digital interoperability, it is imperative that trust frameworks and data exchanges like TEFCA not allow health data to be accessed or stored by non-U.S. entities or unauthorized individuals. We ask that the HHS and CMS enforce strict digital identity credentialing and limit PHI access strictly to credentialed U.S. citizens working under direct U.S. jurisdiction.

Failure to enact these protections risks further erosion of patient trust and presents a cybersecurity, privacy, and national security threat in U.S. territories like the CNMI.

Other VBC programs, such as MSSP, are provided such data on a monthly basis while other VBC programs are not.  This is an egregious disadvantage in being able to perform well in these programs along with the inability to effectively manage patients as there are huge gaps in knowledge regarding the healthcare being provided.

The use of health management tools cannot be done without the whole picture of a patient's healthcare journey, and the ability to create that picture requires more insight into the patients care through claims data from CMS.

Medicare beneficiaries and clinical practices, especially in community settings will need help to exploit the power of the information age and digital/virtual healthcare.  None of the various efforts by the private and public sectors has succeeded at making healthcare more efficient, more satisfying, and easier to receive and provide. A major reason is the lack of assistance to change-- practices and patient behaviors.  

2. Available for immediate exploitation is a national ""Health Extension Service"" modeled after the agriculture extension service--credited with transforming agriculture and rural communities for more than a century--a famous American contribution to the entire world.  The translation of agriculture's experience into healthcare has been nurtured in multiple states in creative public/private partnerships since the 1990's and is poised for scaling.  The idea is simple:  establish locally dwelling community members who know the local terrain and situation, unite them into a statewide system with connections to new knowledge and technology, and let them establish personal, direct relationships with practices and community organizations. The successful models have been organized and sustained for decades through federal, state, private partnerships.  

3. Right now, 39 states have submitted proposals in response to a call for proposals by the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research to expand their initial ""health extension"" efforts throughout their states to help practices IMPLEMENT changes that are practical and useful to patients.  Two big changes are trying to happen and need facilitation-- use of digital platforms for care everywhere- and- integration of primary care practices with mental and public health. These submitted proposals build from years of experimentation and invention of health extension agents (new job) and are awaiting staffing for review now. Funded by the PCOR trust fund, this is an easy, shovel-ready opportunity to exploit to enable the challenging work of a major transformation of health care--moving medicine and the rest of healthcare into the information age by providing practical, local help.  It is like a hammer--it can be used to build a lot of things.  It is like cell phone, it can serve multiple purposes that shift and morph over time. Unlike so much of healthcare it engages local communities in an affordable way--neighbors helping neighbors, under the existing circumstances.

I am providing input as a stakeholder interested in improving patient access, provider efficiency, and the digital health ecosystem.

I. General Observations

CMS and ONC have made progress in building a standards-based, interoperable health data ecosystem through initiatives like Blue Button 2.0, FHIR APIs, and TEFCA. However, challenges remain in achieving seamless, patient-centric access, reducing provider burden, and fostering digital health innovation.

A. Patients and Caregivers
PC-1 & PC-2: Health Management and Access

Patients need integrated health apps to:

View all data (claims, notes, imaging, labs) in one place.

Schedule appointments, get reminders, access cost estimates.

Share data securely with caregivers and providers.

Fragmented portals force patients to manage multiple logins, impeding care coordination.

PC-4 & PC-5: Missing Features and CMS Role

Key missing features include:

Universal data aggregation across payers/providers.

Real-time provider availability.

Personalized health guidance.

CMS could:

Promote open standards and certify digital health products for usability and accessibility.

Enhance beneficiary education on digital tools.

Support reimbursement for digital engagement.

PC-6: Accessibility

Digital health products should prioritize:

Simple interfaces.

Multilingual support and assistive tech.

Low digital literacy requirements and robust support.

PC-9: Blue Button 2.0 API Improvements

Expanding data beyond claims to include clinical notes, imaging, and social determinants would increase value.

Simplifying authentication and enabling third-party integrations would foster innovation.

B. Providers
PR-1 & PR-2: Digital Health Adoption

Barriers include workflow disruption, lack of EHR integration, and insufficient incentives.

CMS can help by:

Streamlining certification for digital products.

Providing technical help, especially in rural settings.

Aligning digital health with value-based care.

PR-3: Interoperability of All Data

Making all EHR data (including scanned docs and free text) interoperable is critical but challenging.

Prioritize structured data exchange while developing standards for unstructured data.

PR-8: Quality Data Reporting

Bulk FHIR exports could reduce reporting burden if CMS handles quality metric calculations.

C. Payers
PA-2 & PA-3: API Implementation and Digital Identity

CMS should incentivize open APIs for data sharing.

Encouraging standardized digital identity credentials would improve security and access.

D. Technology Vendors and Data Providers
TD-1 & TD-2: Stimulating Developer Interest

CMS can stimulate innovation by:

Expanding available data sets.

Offering clear APIs and sandbox environments.

Reducing regulatory uncertainty.

TD-4 & TD-5: Open Standards and Provider Directory

Require open, standards-based APIs.

A nationwide, public FHIR endpoint directory would facilitate secure data exchange.

E. Value-Based Care Organizations
VB-1 & VB-3: Digital Health in APMs

Value-based organizations need interoperable tools for care planning and quality measurement.

CMS should tailor requirements to support these needs, with flexibility for smaller providers.

F. Information Blocking and Digital Identity
PC-13, PR-12, TD-18: Information Blocking

CMS should simplify the process for submitting information blocking complaints.

Stronger enforcement and clear disincentives are needed.

PC-14, PR-9, TD-3: Digital Identity

Standardized digital identity credentials would streamline access and enhance security.

CMS should work with providers and developers to encourage adoption.

G. Recommendations
Expand Data Access: Broaden API data to include clinical notes, imaging, and social determinants.

Promote Open Standards: Mandate open APIs and a national FHIR endpoint directory.

Simplify User Experience: Invest in user-friendly interfaces and digital literacy support.

Support Provider Adoption: Align digital health with value-based care and reduce reporting burden.

Foster Innovation: Provide clear guidance and technical support.

Strengthen Oversight: Enhance enforcement against information blocking and promote digital identity credentials.

One critical opportunity is to better support family caregivers- the invisible frontline of elder care. These are the people making decisions at 9 PM, in Spanish, after their loved one has been discharged, with no case manager in sight.

I urge CMS to recognize and fund technologies that:

Use AI and voice interfaces to guide caregivers in real time,

Explain plan benefits (like meals, rides, home care) clearly and in multiple languages, available after work hours and on weekends,

Track benefit usage to meet required CMS reporting and Star Rating needs,

Give caregivers tools to access benefits without turning them into providers.

If CMS is serious about meeting people where they are, then modern tools must be multilingual, accessible after hours, and built around trusted family relationships, not just patient portals.

Please ensure that future digital health policy supports non-clinical, trustworthy AI-powered tools that help caregivers navigate the system to support their aging loved ones.

As a chronic pain patient I have been adversely impacted by the current way data is shared between government agencies. Data has been used to identify doctors and patients as noncompliant outliers yet the algorithms used to create the database search engine unavailable and its classified information. Yet prosecutors are getting convict by controlling that information process. Doctors who’ve not been the pill mills we were told about, those are long gone. This is prohibition through the back door. 

Database engineers are not law enforcement and shouldn’t be treated as the end all for the government. To me, this is laziness for government law who now work “list” generated by a database search and consider the data as 100% reliable not even taking enough time to adequately evaluate each individual on the list prior to initiating a legal action. 

Finally. At 63 and on Medicare I am incredibly frightened by the way medical has been impacted by data compliance issues. We are managed by computers and rely on the integrity of our care staff to ensure data accuracy. We need accountability for the integrity of the data used in decision analysis.

Problem
The end-user dispensing pharmacy and end-user prescribing physician have endless regulations to follow when prescribing opioids, but the final user patient has no rules or regulations at home and can easily misuse, divert, actually overdose on the opioid they are prescribed. 

That is the reason 75% of patients don’t take their prescribed medications correctly which results in 125,000 deaths annually and $290 billion per year in additional healthcare expenditures because of higher rates of hospital admissions, suboptimal health outcomes, and higher morbidity/mortality for chronic conditions.
 
With opioids, opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose death can occur.  In 2023, there were 110,000 opioid overdose deaths at a cost of $2.7 trillion in medical expenses, unemployment, homelessness and crime.   We have medications to treat OUD and reduce opioid overdose deaths by 50% but only 11% of patients can get these medications due to significant barriers to access care, including lack of transportation, lack of childcare, lack of healthcare literacy, stigma, healthcare inequities, geographical disparities, health disparities, and reduction of social determinants of health. 

Each overdose death costs $24.545 million.  ($2.7 trillion/110,000)

iPill technology brings holistic care to patients with pill and patient monitoring.  

iPill provides : 
    * secure home delivery and storage 
    * biometric precise dispensing of medications only to the prescription 
       holder at only the prescribed schedule.
    * destruction of unused pills at 30 days and immediately if tampered
    * remote medication adherence monitoring to detect/remediate missed daily doses
    * notification alerts to family, friends, and caregivers for missed doses,
    * data Integration sync with Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and Superscripts 
    * capture of vital signs via faceprint AI 
    * psychosocial support via telehealth

Need
There is an immediate need for the iPill to increase patient access to treatment.  iPill’s versatility stems from the ability to securely and precisely dispense medications of varying shapes and sizes so opioids, opioid use disorder medications, sedatives, stimulants, tranquilizers, HIV drugs, specialty, and oncologic drugs can be used in the iPill dispenser.

65% of the jail population has OUD.  The detainees are not treated for OUD in jail and after release, have a 129 times higher chance of overdose death in the 2 weeks after release, a 75% higher risk of relapse, a 75% higher risk of recidivism, and a 50% chance of re-incarceration.  iPill could be made a mandatory part of early parole requiring 12 months of continuous treatment at an OUD clinic, Paid for with opioid litigation settlement funds and reimbursement from remote patient monitoring code remote therapeutic monitoring codes, iPill could improve treatment retention, reduce relapse, and save money and and lives.  

In the Veterans administration, there are 208 OUD clinics in the VA system treating 6,500 vets but 418,000 American Veterans need treatment but are unable to get treatment.  The result has been 44 veterans dying a day from suicide and overdoses.  iPill could be used to securely delivery, store, and dispense medications and deliver care with a virtual doctor and nurse in their homes.  iPill could be used to save veterans lives.","Association - Device",,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2025-0050-0093/attachment_2.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2025-0050-0093/attachment_1.pdf","pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Thank you for the opportunity to respond to this critical RFI. Kbrax is a health technology company committed to advancing equitable, whole-person care for Medicare beneficiaries and underserved populations through interoperable, intelligent tools. Our work is grounded in the pillars of access to care, quality of care, cost efficiency, and care innovation.
We built the CompleteCarePlatform to unify care coordination, behavioral health, and AI-driven insights into one scalable solution that empowers both patients and care teams. Including:
•             CareNavigator: a care coordination platform that enables advocates and navigators to track care journeys, close gaps, and respond to risk signals in real-time.
•             MindPure: a patient-facing mobile app that promotes mental health, self-awareness, and proactive engagement, especially for seniors and those facing stigma around behavioral health.
•             State-driven AI engine: an intelligent prioritization layer that personalizes outreach, assigns tasks, and integrates behavioral, medical, and social data to support timely intervention.
Our platform equips care advocates to shepherd Medicare members to appropriate, high-quality, cost-effective, and culturally relevant care, regardless of geography, digital literacy, or socioeconomic status. We’ve designed our tools to be low-friction and inclusive, supporting care in the home, community settings, and remote areas.
Kbrax strongly supports CMS and ONC’s leadership in promoting FHIR-based APIs, TEFCA connectivity, and open data access. Our platform is interoperability-ready and already integrates ADT events, claims, and patient-generated health data. We encourage CMS to further expand access to behavioral, social, and historical provider notes through APIs, such as Blue Button 2.0.
We also support efforts to enhance digital identity management, minimize information blocking, and align CEHRT requirements with the actual needs of value-based care providers. Future certification criteria should include coordination and navigation tools, such as CareNavigator, in addition to traditional Electronic Health Records (EHRs).
Above all, technology must humanize care. Every feature we build centers on the patient’s story, whether it’s tracking social needs, detecting silent deterioration in behavioral health, or ensuring a timely follow-up after discharge. We believe patients deserve not just access to care but access to care that is personalized, proactive, and compassionate.
We have attached a more extended version of this comment, including detailed responses and examples of how CompleteCarePlatform supports CMS goals and public health transformation. We welcome the opportunity to partner with CMS and ONC on future pilots, innovation initiatives, or advisory input.
With gratitude for your leadership and shared commitment to equitable, innovative care,

This response highlights how Tennr's comprehensive system is crucial for improving patient outcomes, reducing care delays, and, critically, for assisting CMS in effectively managing and scaling its oversight responsibilities, particularly concerning the increasingly rigorous Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) audits.

With CMS significantly strengthening RADV audits through annual reviews, increased record sampling, and extrapolation of findings to entire contracts, the need for robust documentation integrity at scale is paramount. Tennr proposes to provide its Qualifications product and ICD-10 code extraction model directly to the CMS RADV audit team. This technology can enable CMS to proactively identify and validate diagnoses at scale, efficiently review audits by automating medical record validation, enhance financial integrity by ensuring accurate documentation for billed diagnoses, and complement CMS's own enhanced technology and growing medical coder team.

Tennr's Qualifications product leverages machine learning to determine if medical necessity is met for HCPCS codes ordered against corresponding Medicare LCD’s and NCD’s, while RaeLM (TM) accurately extracts and transforms complex narrative descriptions into standardized ICD-10 codes. This capability ensures that diagnoses are fully supported by medical records, mitigating the risk of unsupported codes and facilitating the generation of comprehensive ""proof packets"" for audits. By integrating Tennr's high-confidence automation, CMS can streamline its audit processes, reduce manual review burdens, and ultimately protect the Medicare Trust Fund from improper payments.

Unlike the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, Medicare is a Closed System—And That’s Hurting Beneficiaries

In the Marketplace, consumers can easily compare every available plan thanks to public APIs and federally maintained exchanges. Private innovators can build tools and experiences that improve transparency and ease of enrollment. Brokers are empowered to serve clients by showing all their options without artificial restrictions from insurers.

In stark contrast, the Medicare ecosystem is closed and highly restricted. Plan data is not accessible via APIs. Carriers selectively decide which brokers or e-brokers can represent their plans, granting or revoking access at their discretion—often based on commercial favoritism, not consumer interest.

This creates a perverse dynamic: brokers, who should serve as unbiased advisors, are functionally captive to the whims of carriers. I’ve personally experienced—and can verify—that a broker's ability to represent plans can be revoked arbitrarily, for reasons unrelated to compliance or ethics. It’s a shadowy gatekeeping structure that undermines the entire promise of informed choice in Medicare.

Medicare Must Embrace Open Infrastructure—Modeled After Healthcare.gov

CMS should mandate open access to Medicare Advantage and Part D plan data through public APIs. This would empower developers, FMOs, agencies, and consumer-facing platforms to build comparison tools that reflect the full market—not just the subset a carrier allows them to display.

This would also:

Foster innovation: Open data allows third-party tools, consumer apps, and nonprofit organizations to build decision support systems tailored to different populations—rural, multilingual, low-income, etc.

Promote transparency: Beneficiaries deserve to see all their options, not just those tied to certain marketing agreements.

Level the playing field: Carriers should not be allowed to block brokers who are otherwise fully certified and compliant with CMS rules. Centralized credentialing and certification—administered by CMS, not carriers—would protect consumer interests.

Carrier-Driven Oversight Is Undermining Broker Neutrality

Brokers should be accountable to CMS, not beholden to each carrier’s internal compliance department. Today, carriers exploit marketing rules to enforce loyalty or punish dissent. These opaque enforcement mechanisms create a culture of fear and bias among brokers—precisely what CMS has said it wants to avoid.

If we want brokers to be unbiased advocates for the consumer, we must remove the perverse incentives created by the current contracting system.

Recommendations for CMS Consideration:

Create Public APIs for Medicare Advantage and Part D plan data, modeled after Healthcare.gov’s approach, enabling both public and private plan-finder platforms to flourish.

Implement centralized, CMS-controlled certification and contracting for brokers—eliminating carrier-specific restrictions that limit consumer access and distort broker incentives.

Prohibit carriers from selectively approving or terminating broker relationships without cause or due process. Broker eligibility should be based on CMS compliance and training alone.

Modernize Medicare marketing rules to reflect a platform-neutral, data-driven ecosystem that fosters innovation while safeguarding consumers.

We need a Medicare system that is transparent, fair, and technologically open—where brokers serve as true fiduciaries for the beneficiaries they represent. CMS has a rare opportunity to create infrastructure parity between the ACA Marketplace and Medicare. Let’s not waste it.

As a licensed Medicare agent who has spent years guiding retirees and near-retirees through their Medicare options, I strongly support modernizing the Medicare enrollment and plan comparison experience. Our current system is outdated, opaque, and burdensome—not just for brokers, but for the very individuals Medicare is supposed to protect.

Unlike the ACA Marketplace, Medicare lacks a centralized, transparent platform for plan comparison and enrollment. Brokers are forced to navigate restrictive and fragmented carrier relationships, where access to plan data and enrollment tools is tightly controlled and can be revoked without cause. This leaves consumers at a disadvantage and undermines the goal of offering unbiased, comprehensive support.

I respectfully urge CMS to consider the following:

Develop public APIs for Medicare plan data to allow third parties and developers to build robust, consumer-friendly tools.

Centralize and streamline broker certification and contracting under CMS rather than individual carriers.

Implement protections against arbitrary de-appointment of brokers who are licensed, certified, and compliant.

Allow technology-driven innovation in Medicare plan comparison tools, similar to the ACA model.

Revise marketing rules in a way that balances consumer protections with the freedom to provide educational, transparent outreach.

If CMS is committed to empowering Medicare beneficiaries, the system must prioritize accessibility, neutrality, and accountability—not corporate gatekeeping.

Subject: Public Comment on Digital Infrastructure Needs to Support Value-Based Care

To the CMS and ONC teams,

Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the Request for Information on modernizing the Medicare health technology ecosystem. As a company working closely with independent provider organizations—particularly Community Health Centers (CHCs), provider-led ACOs, and regional CINs—we deeply support CMS’s vision of improving care coordination, transparency, and equity through digital infrastructure.

We write today to respond specifically to the section of the RFI focused on Value-Based Care (VBC) and the role that digital infrastructure plays in advancing its success.

⸻

Key Recommendations for VBC Enablement

1. Create enforceable data standards that ensure real-time, two-way data exchange between payers and providers.
Providers in VBC arrangements often lack timely access to the very data they are measured on—claims, attribution, quality results, and benchmark performance. One CHC partner of ours, participating in both Medicaid MCO and MSSP programs, experienced a 90-day delay in receiving performance data, only to learn they had missed an incentive opportunity due to outdated rosters and unaccounted exclusions. These gaps aren’t just frustrating—they are financially and operationally damaging.

We recommend CMS:
	•	Establish minimum standards for structured, real-time data exchange in VBC programs
	•	Incentivize or require payers to share quality and financial performance data at monthly or quarterly intervals
	•	Include provider-facing APIs and flat file formats that do not require EHR customization or additional licenses

2. Prioritize CHC and safety-net provider needs in digital health infrastructure investments.
CHCs serve over 30 million patients—yet they’re often excluded from interoperability discussions due to limited resources or vendor support. Several of our CHC clients struggle with inconsistent payer file formats, missing risk scores, or performance logic that can’t be independently validated.

CMS should:
	•	Fund and promote shared data infrastructure at the regional or PCA/HCCN level
	•	Encourage open performance scoring methodologies to reduce dependence on opaque vendor tools
	•	Promote “plug-and-play” tooling for small and mid-sized organizations to analyze and act on data

Note: Syntax Health currently supports several provider organizations—including CHCs, academic faculty practices, and ACO-aligned networks—with actuarial modeling, contract performance tools, and actionable analytics that simplify VBC execution. This work has demonstrated that when providers have access to timely, interpretable data, they can renegotiate contracts, avoid missed incentives, and improve outcomes—all without increasing administrative burden.

3. Reduce administrative burden by supporting integrated VBC tooling.
Digital infrastructure should not add to the reporting burden—it should reduce it. We see provider organizations managing VBC contracts in dozens of spreadsheets and PDFs, leading to errors and missed opportunities.

We recommend CMS:
	•	Recognize or certify tools that integrate contracting, performance measurement, and financial reconciliation
	•	Encourage modular infrastructure that supports providers of all sizes—not just IDNs with in-house tech teams
	•	Consider demonstration projects that validate how digital tools improve provider experience and outcomes in VBC

4. Center equity and transparency in VBC data infrastructure.
Medicare’s digital health transformation must serve all providers and patients. This includes:
	•	Publishing benchmarks and scoring algorithms used to determine shared savings
	•	Ensuring attribution logic and risk adjustment are accessible, explainable, and updatable
	•	Supporting VBC enablement for providers serving rural and underserved populations, including CHCs, tribal clinics, and Medicaid-focused ACOs

⸻

Closing Thoughts

Radical change requires practical people. We urge CMS and ONC to design this modernization effort with real-world providers in mind—especially those serving high-need populations. A more transparent, timely, and equitable digital ecosystem is not just a technology issue—it’s foundational to Medicare’s success in value-based care.

We are grateful for your leadership and would welcome future opportunities to collaborate.

Sincerely,

As a stakeholder engaged in health IT transformation for Community Health Centers, I appreciate the opportunity to provide the following comments and recommendations aligned with the RFI’s key focus areas:

Patients & Caregivers
CMS should collaborate with digital literacy initiatives to ensure digital tools are accessible to seniors, low-income populations, and marginalized communities. I recommend that CMS fund pilot programs to support the development of “navigation-first” digital health apps that prioritize ease of use for appointment scheduling, care team communication, and personal health goal tracking.

Providers
The administrative burden on providers related to quality reporting and interoperability compliance remains significant. CMS should consider allowing EHR vendors to transmit aggregated, risk-adjusted quality metrics directly to CMS using Bulk FHIR APIs, which would reduce manual reporting and improve workflow efficiency.

Payers
Many payers still lack standardized APIs for data exchange. CMS should align payer expectations with Blue Button and Data at Point of Care initiatives, and link payer participation in CMS programs to demonstrable progress in adopting digital identity standards and FHIR-based APIs.

Technology Vendors & Networks
ONC certification pathways continue to be complex for developers, particularly those building innovative or non-traditional applications. I recommend the creation of a “Digital Health Innovation Certification Track” focused on real-world usability testing and API functionality, rather than traditional modular certification.

Value-Based Care (VBC) Organizations
For VBC models to succeed, timely access to data is critical. However, delays in data transmission and the lack of longitudinal insights hinder care coordination. CMS should incentivize technology vendors to natively support event notifications, accurate patient matching, and care planning APIs in VBC-certified platforms.

Cross-Cutting Recommendations

Centralized Digital Health Resource Hub: CMS should establish a national resource center for developers that includes access to sandbox environments, interoperability toolkits, data standards documentation, and patient-centered design feedback mechanisms.

Metrics-Driven Evaluation Framework: CMS should adopt a digital maturity model to evaluate the uptake of APIs, patient access/utilization, care coordination improvements, and digital health app performance.

Expand Blue Button Beyond Medicare: I encourage CMS to broaden the scope of Blue Button 2.0 to include Medicaid and dual-eligible populations, which would improve access and support innovation for underserved communities.

These recommendations are grounded in the realities of community-based care delivery and are intended to support a more inclusive, interoperable, and outcomes-driven digital health infrastructure.

In this AI era, where obtaining information to make timely decisions, such as buying a house, a car, planning a vacation or ordering groceries can all be done seamlessly from a mobile device. 

That cannot be said for the healthcare industry. The patience experience and engagement from patients, providers to payers and even labs must be unified. 

This can be achieved through a vetted process reengineering approach between key stakeholders. Eventually producing the much-needed information and data integrity to streamline healthcare, reduce costs and improve patient experience. 

Above all, for AI to function well, it will rely on good data infrastructure.

As his caregiver and a Board-Certified Patient Advocate, I know that wasn’t just an administrative oversight. It was a systems failure. And he’s not the only one it failed.

I’m the full-time, unpaid caregiver for my Kindergarten-aged son, a four-time brain cancer and stroke survivor. I’m also a healthcare professional with 15 years of experience and deep expertise in HIPAA, EHR interoperability, and data governance. Despite this, I spend 30+ hours per week navigating clinical coordination, insurance, pharmacy logistics, and provider communication just to keep my son’s care on track. There are no support systems or labor protections for this role. Most caregivers aren’t industry experts. I am, and it’s still unbearable.

System Failures I've Lived Through:
1. EHRs That Stall Complex Care: Designed for single-provider workflows, EHRs block collaboration on second opinions, trials, or innovative treatments.
2. Burned-Out Clinicians Who Resist Innovation: Creativity, like dietary interventions or off-label use, is often dismissed, even when evidence-backed.
3. Trauma Ignored: Caregivers navigating crisis after crisis need trauma-informed policies. Right now, we’re invisible.
4. Medicaid Coverage Gaps: My son was dropped mid-treatment. Reinstatement took intensive advocacy that most families don’t have the bandwidth to fight for.
5. No Protections, No Pay: If a nurse doesn’t show up, it’s my problem. If records don’t transfer, it’s on me. And yet, the system treats me like a liability, not a care partner.
6. Opaque Pricing: We face critical financial decisions with zero cost transparency.
7. Real-World Use of AI is Ignored: Families like mine are already using tools like ChatGPT to organize care and advocate. These realities should inform policy now, not in five years.

Recommendations to CMS:
To address these failures and empower caregivers as integral care partners, CMS must:
1. Establish a Patient & Family Workgroup: Include lived-experience experts in shaping federal healthcare innovation.
2. Fairly Compensate Workgroup Members: Ensure equitable access by removing financial participation barriers.
3. Implement Trauma-Informed Protocols: Require providers and systems to account for caregiver mental health.
4. Fix Medicaid Administrative Failures: No patient should lose access to care mid-treatment due to state-level errors.
5. Reduce Caregiver Administrative Burden: Streamline documentation, authorizations, and records access for designated caregivers.
6. Use Real-World Use Cases in Policy: AI, health data tools, and new care navigation platforms already have traction in families. Learn from us.
7. Establish Labor Protections for Caregivers: Treat caregiving as essential work, not invisible labor.
8. Mandate Price Transparency: Require providers and payers to disclose true costs upfront.
9. Shift Data Ownership to Patients: Patients and caregivers need control, not gatekeepers.
10. Prioritize the Human Experience: Design systems around people, not processes.

Why This Matters Now:
This comment supports the Quintuple Aim: improving patient and caregiver experience, reducing costs, improving outcomes, addressing health equity, and protecting healthcare workers’ well-being.

If caregivers remain unsupported, healthcare becomes unsustainable for everyone. We are the invisible infrastructure holding up your outcomes data, your readmission metrics, and your treatment adherence. Yet we are systemically ignored, unprotected, and burned out.

As a caregiver, board-certified patient advocate, and healthcare professional, I urge CMS to act now. This is not just about improving workflows. It’s about protecting lives and preserving the sustainability of our entire system.

Thank you for the opportunity to share this. I welcome the chance to support this work as a professional advocate and lived-experience expert.","Individual",,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I am an individual insurance Broker that specializes in Medicare products.

I do not believe the technology is broken.

What is broken however, is the process. Specifically the call centers that are constantly cold calling seniors about their Medicare Coverage, and the year-round Special Election Periods that enable people to change their plans any time they want.

Want to fix the millions of marketing complaints? Get Joe Namath off the TV, find a way to stop the cold calls, and end the non-stop SEPs that allow the churning.

I can promise you the local small-time brokers are not the problem. Its the SEPs that ENABLE the churning, and the billion dollar call centers using speed dialers cold calling people that are.

I have 2-3 clients a day calling me, all saying the same thing ""Dave, I just got a cold call from someone saying that they're from Medicare, and there is NEW things happening, and I should change me plan!""


I am a small time broker, that works exclusively in my community. I do not cross state lines. I have relationships with every one of my clients. I promise you, you are focusing on the wrong thing. Start  with the non-stop SEPs, then crack down on the cold calls.

Once that is fixed, sure update the website, launch Blue Button 3.0 and allow broker-developers to create their own API.

But that is not going to stop the abuse from the cold callers churning during decades long SEPs.

Thank you for asking for comments about ""how best to advance a seamless, secure, and patient-centered digital health infrastructure.""

My experience comes from providing caregiver to my father (diabetes) and mother (assisted living) who both passed several years ago. I work in information technology (remote monitoring, cybersecurity, AI, entrepreneurship). I have tested and used advancements related to managing chronic care and proactive self-care.

My comment is to look for platforms, products and services that are proven and led by leadership teams who understand the healthcare landscape. One such product I've used is the Addison Care platform (Addison specifically) from Electronic Caregiver (ECG). ECG knows the chronic care market and has enrolled patients in Medicaid, Medicare, and private pay. They have partnerships with leading technology companies and are scaling their business through the use of avatars that provide AI-supported care to patients and caregivers. ECG is a leader in terms of intellectual property (27 patents) so incorporating their technology can be done by other parties.

There will continue to be an expanding ecosystem in information health technology. Choosing wisely among initial players will help everyone build more a more seamless, secure, and patient-centered digital health infrastructure.

Fully disclosure: I am an investor in ECG.

Thank you.","Federal Government - G0005",,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I am a fall risk with osetoarthritis, and being able to speak to my doctors or therapists online instead of needing to leave my house has been incredibly helpful to me. I recognize that some appointments would require me to physically leave my home, such as for testing purposes, but when telehealth would be an option, I'd like to be able to have the appointments I can have through it.
One other thing I believe would make my healthcare easier to manage would be if I could have my medications delivered to me from the pharmacy I currently go to. Said pharmacy is through Walmart. It would extraordinarily helpful, not just for me, but for many people if similar businesses allowed medications through their pharmacies to be delivered to your doorstep, or for them to be picked up through the same process some grocery stores offer to place an order and pick up the items. Many medications require being stored at room temperature, so for delivery services, having them delivered in cooler boxes during summer months would most likely be necessary.
I feel as though MyChart should not have a monopoly on electronic/online health services. After all, what will happen if MyChart goes down? What will happen to medical records if MyChart goes bankrupt, or what about the times MyChart's services are unavailable? Sure, there's always pen and paper, and yes, services being temporarily unavailable is a well-known risk online. However, people across the nation are affected by MyChart's services, including when they go down. Many doctors have their schedules booked for months at a time. What happens to patients who need these telehealth services for time-sensitive and/or life-threatening conditions if MyChart suddenly stops working? Perhaps healthcare providers and hospitals should be able to connect to multiple websites with similar services that are NOT connected to MyChart, so if one goes down, there are backups. I don't believe they should be required to enter a formal contract for this, and exclusivity deals shouldn't be allowed. MyChart is very useful, but it should not have the power that it does over the healthcare industry.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

These same records can serve as the authoritative source for claims adjudication at the individual level, enabling fraud detection and eliminating vast administrative waste, producing immediate financial savings across the system. A national clearinghouse for EHR data would allow us to strategically optimize healthcare resources, guiding dollars toward what works and away from duplicative or ineffective interventions. Critically, this transformation does not require futuristic infrastructure or sweeping regulatory overhaul; it can be implemented today with minimal disruption. The long-term vision is clear: a learning health system that pays for what delivers results, not just what gets used, the true promise of value-based care and performance-driven payment.
Summary of Comments:

• The majority of clinically relevant facts, including cancer staging, biomarkers, social-risk factors, and imaging findings, remain hidden in unstructured notes and embedded image files. Unlocking that data is a prerequisite for quality care, accurate risk adjustment, timely gap closure, addressing health disparities, and detection of fraud or waste, which are all critical components of a modern, equitable healthcare system.

• AI-driven data extraction is production-ready, supporting data modernization. We have published validation for AI-based extraction yielding very high accuracy for clinically relevant details, yielding up to a five-fold information gain compared with document-level C-CDA alone and even larger improvements over current FHIR data exchange. Our customers are using these enhancements to close care gaps and fix the data-quality gap that hinders value-based contracts.

• CMS should treat computable, patient-level data, not just the envelope documents, as the default payload for TEFCA, Blue Button, and Bulk-FHIR transactions to effectively drive health equity, support value-based care, and enhance program integrity.

Our comments focus on the potential of digital therapeutics (DTx) to improve maternal mental health (MMH) outcomes and the necessary federal policy infrastructure to support their effective use.

A notable example is MamaLift Plus, the first FDA-approved DTx for maternal mental health, which integrates evidence-based screening and treatment into a mobile app. Designed to promote open engagement and reduce stigma, it also features EMR integration and care team coordination. Clinical evidence shows it can divert two-thirds of cases from progressing into severe depression.

Recommendations for CMS Action
Standardize EMR Functionality: CMS should require primary care and OB EMRs to include clinical prompts based on evidence-based guidelines, such as routine screeners for maternal depression and anxiety. This standardization would ensure consistent care delivery and generate actionable clinical data for research.
Reimbursement Clarity for DTx: The 2025 Physician Fee Schedule introduces coding for digital mental health therapeutic (DMHT) devices, but without a national reimbursement framework, CMS risks fragmented implementation. Deferring to the seven regional Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) may lead to inconsistent reimbursement rates and deter adoption. A unified billing policy is needed to drive provider and developer engagement.
Address Digital Literacy and Broadband Gaps: Federal support for digital literacy programs and broadband expansion, especially in rural areas, is essential. This would help overcome a major barrier to adoption among both patients and providers.
Promote Awareness and Training: CMS should support provider education on the distinctions between DTx and wellness apps, emphasizing their FDA oversight, clinical trial validation, and privacy protections. Use case demonstrations, reimbursement guidance, and integration strategies are key to broader uptake.
Responses to Select RFI Questions
PC-3: Health apps beneficial to Medicare patients and caregivers
MamaLift Plus exemplifies how DTx can enhance patient engagement, provide clinical insight, and connect seamlessly to provider EMRs. These features enable early identification of MMH conditions, timely interventions, and continuous care coordination.

PC-5a: Increasing adoption of digital health tools
Policy changes such as establishing clear reimbursement pathways, enhancing EMR integration, and educating stakeholders on DTx capabilities will accelerate adoption. Awareness campaigns and provider incentives are also necessary.

PC-6: Key accessibility features for digital tools
Accessibility hinges on broadband availability and digital literacy. Federal investment in state-level training and technology infrastructure can close gaps in access—critical to addressing geographic disparities in MMH outcomes.

PC-8c: Improving data interoperability and use
Standardized EMR platforms and integration of validated screening tools can streamline data collection and analysis. CMS should coordinate with vendors and standards bodies to align data elements and improve research quality and care delivery.

PR-1: Encouraging provider use of approved digital tools
Providers need education, support, and real-world examples to feel confident in prescribing DTx. Obstacles include infrastructure gaps, reimbursement uncertainty, and limited awareness—particularly in rural areas.

PR-1a: Information providers should share with patients
Providers must explain that DTx like MamaLift Plus undergo rigorous FDA review, are HIPAA-compliant, and maintain strict data security standards—on par with traditional medical treatments.

PR-1b: Provider responsibilities
DTx should supplement, not replace, clinician-managed care. Providers are responsible for monitoring use and ensuring patients remain connected to appropriate in-person or virtual clinical support.

The internet's incredible success and interoperability are built upon foundational protocols like TCP/IP and HTTP. These protocols define how data is transmitted and secured, allowing countless different applications and services to communicate seamlessly, regardless of the underlying hardware or software. This model offers a powerful parallel for the future of healthcare interoperability.

Currently, the healthcare landscape is fragmented by proprietary systems and varying data exchange methods, creating significant barriers to efficient, secure, and comprehensive patient care. Mandating or favoring specific platforms stifles innovation, creates vendor lock-in, and ultimately hinders the fluid exchange of critical patient information across different healthcare providers and systems.

Instead, CMS should focus its efforts on developing and enforcing a robust set of common, vendor-agnostic protocols that define:

- Data Structure and Semantics: How health data is organized and understood consistently across systems.

- Secure Exchange Mechanisms: Standardized methods for encrypting and transmitting sensitive patient information.

- Authentication and Authorization: Protocols for verifying identities and controlling access to health data.

- Event-Driven Notifications: Standardized ways for systems to alert each other about relevant patient events (e.g., admissions, discharges, lab results).

By championing a protocol-centric approach, CMS can foster a truly interoperable healthcare ecosystem that benefits patients, providers, and innovators alike. This approach will:

- Promote Competition and Innovation: Allow a diverse array of vendors to develop solutions that comply with common standards, leading to better products and services.

- Reduce Costs: Eliminate the need for complex, custom integrations between disparate systems, saving significant resources for healthcare organizations.

- Improve Patient Care: Enable more complete and timely access to patient information, leading to better-informed clinical decisions and coordinated care.

- Enhance Data Security: Provide a consistent framework for secure data exchange, making it easier to identify and address vulnerabilities.

I urge CMS to learn from the lessons of the internet's open architecture and apply them to the critical task of achieving true healthcare interoperability. By focusing on defining the ""how"" through protocols, rather than the ""what"" through platforms, CMS can pave the way for a more connected, efficient, and patient-centered healthcare system.","Health Care Industry - PI015",,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

FOR PATIENT-PROTECTION AND HOSPITAL PREPAREDNESS

PROBLEM:
U.S. Healthcare is fragile due to its heavy dependence on interconnected IT systems, with continuous ransomware cyberattacks leading to frequent hospital outages impacting hundreds of thousands of patients.  To date current attempts to decrease this fragility have been reactive to individual events and government guidance reports, leaving the state of healthcare cybersecurity protection as both unmeasured and unknown.    

To be specific, at its core the U.S. healthcare system consists of interstate hospital systems, intrastate hospital systems, and independent hospitals.  The independent hospitals are mostly rural, and are particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks which can create severe continuity-of-care disruptions and even hospital closures - leaving entire communities without timely healthcare responsiveness for acute events.  

SOLUTION:

Working closely with a CMS threat intelligence (CTI) expert who provided requirements and originally developed the idea, we have used state-of-the-art U.S. technology to create a cybersecurity measurement system that can quantitatively measure cybersecurity metrics and provide a summary cybersecurity rating FOR ALL U.S. HOSPITALS thus providing measurement data and understanding about how best to proactively protect U.S. hospitals. We can thus proactively identify problems at hospitals in advance to prevent and deter cyberattacks instead of reactively addressing the aftermath of individual hospital shutdown events.

Leveraging the best available state-of-the-art U.S. technology, we have created a cybersecurity measurement system for ALL U.S. HOSPITALS, called CHART-PULL, which is now operational in a laboratory setting providing near-real-time information (updated nightly) and immediately poised to become a production system to support CMS if funded appropriately as a short-term pilot project or multi-year project.  CHART-PULL system is based on empirical analysis of network traffic and scan data. 

Our academic-corporate research team is based at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, including the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) - home of MOSAIC the original Internet browser - and a team of professionals at the BitSight Corporation. 

BACKGROUND:  {only two recent examples, there are many more}
In February 2024, 190 million patients were affected when Change Healthcare suffered a ransomware attack outage which disrupted U.S. pharmacies nationwide for months causing patients to go without prescribed medications and consumer pharmacies to not be reimbursed, at a cost estimated to be $2.5 B.

In May 2024, Ascension Health suffered a ransomware attack outage which closed 140 hospitals affecting millions of patients both currently in the hospitals as well as diverting new patients to other hospitals.  Patients in these hospitals were immediately affected when IT systems were taken offline and doctors had to forgo IT-based protocols for testing, monitoring, and access to electronic medical records.

With the focus on empowering seniors to manage their health journey, it is critical to have a foundational AI-driven platform taking an enterprise-wide approach, cautiously. However, most seniors are not technologically prepared to navigate digital applications but they are familiar with their provider's EHR system,  MyChart. as an example.  For those who want access to their medical records in real time, MyChart is readily available.  

Why not utilize this application making it user friendly for patients to independently access their information at a designated, privately enclosed area at their doctor's clinic the same way they can do so at home?

With proper education, guidance and simple step by step instructions, access can be readily available. Digital tools are sprouting all over and of great concern.  Besides being cost-prohibitive, the risks are many. The service delivered for the patient's benefit maybe seen as eliminating the paperwork for staff but will likely increase the cost of medical care overall.

AI is designed to improve efficiency on repetitive functions. Access to medical records must be protected. Why don't we give the control to keep their records private to the patient?

While these reflections are informed by my experience, they represent my personal perspective and not the official views of my department or employer.

Oral health continues to be siloed from most national health IT and care coordination strategies, despite its undeniable connection to systemic health. Dental providers often operate with electronic dental records (EDRs) that are not interoperable with medical electronic health records (EHRs) or health information exchanges (HIEs). This fragmentation contributes to missed opportunities for care coordination, burdensome documentation processes, and preventable disparities in access and outcomes—particularly for Medicaid-enrolled populations.

To better align with technology-enabled, value-based care, I encourage federal agencies to:

Integrate oral health into national interoperability frameworks and clarify that dental data should be part of health information exchanges and TEFCA implementation.

Support funding and incentives for dental-medical data integration, especially in safety-net settings like FQHCs, school-based programs, and rural clinics.

Encourage adoption of shared clinical terminology and coding systems, including ICD-10 and SNODENT, across EDRs and EHRs to enable coordinated care planning.

Reduce administrative burden by improving real-time data sharing for eligibility, benefits, and prior authorization processes across platforms.

Include oral health professionals and patients in digital health innovation pilots, ensuring that solutions address the specific needs and workflows of dental care delivery.

The path to a connected, patient-centered healthcare system must include oral health.

RE: Request for Information – CMS-0042-NC, Digital Health, Interoperability, and Technology for Medicare Beneficiaries

To whom it may concern,

On behalf of the Medical Alert Monitoring Association (MAMA), the national voice of the personal emergency response services (PERS) industry, we appreciate the opportunity to comment on CMS-0042-NC. Our association represents technology companies and monitoring providers that serve millions of vulnerable Americans, including Medicare beneficiaries living with chronic illness, limited mobility, or other risk factors for injury, hospitalization, or social isolation.

We commend CMS and ASTP/ONC for advancing the national conversation around equitable digital health access and interoperability. We urge you to recognize the essential role PERS plays as an established, scalable, and underutilized tool for achieving the core goals outlined in this RFI: improving health outcomes, reducing costs, and empowering patient-centered care for seniors and individuals with disabilities.

The Value of PERS in a Digital Health Ecosystem

PERS devices and monitoring services are already digital health products. They provide 24/7 access to emergency help and wellness interventions, often integrating with wearable sensors, home-based devices, and remote monitoring platforms. These services are life-saving for patients who live alone, are medically frail, or are at high risk of falls, medication nonadherence, or emergency events.

Despite their decades-long track record, PERS is rarely integrated into broader health IT or value-based care workflows. CMS can lead the way by:

Recognizing PERS as a foundational digital tool that enhances safety, autonomy, and outcomes for high-risk Medicare populations
Incentivizing plans to adopt PERS solutions as part of supplemental benefits, especially under Medicare Advantage, Dual-Eligible Special Needs Plans (D-SNPs), and ACO REACH programs
Creating pathways for PERS data integration into certified health IT platforms (e.g., EHRs or RPM dashboards), so these tools can support preventive interventions and reduce unnecessary hospital admissions
Key Policy Recommendations

We offer the following actionable ideas aligned with the RFI themes:

1. Digital Health Product Inclusion (PC-1, PC-5, VB-1)

CMS should explicitly include PERS and monitoring services in its definition and review of digital health tools eligible for reimbursement or program alignment. PERS should be considered in any future certification, quality, or impact framework for digital products.

2. Data Interoperability and Integration (PC-9, PR-4, TD-10)

To fully realize the value of PERS, CMS should create incentives or guidance that enable the real-time or near-real-time transmission of PERS events and wellness signals into care management platforms used by ACOs, primary care practices, and home-based care teams.

3. Value-Based Care Enablement (VB-3, VB-8)

Many PERS vendors offer capabilities beyond emergency response, including daily check-in features, geolocation tracking, medication reminders, and fall prediction using AI. These features should be recognized as meaningful contributors to value-based care objectives such as reduced ED visits, improved engagement, and early intervention.

4. Accessibility and Adoption (PC-6, PC-7)

Because PERS is already used by seniors with limited digital literacy, it represents a uniquely accessible form of connected care. CMS should invest in research and outcomes reporting on PERS usage, including its impact on loneliness, emergency room utilization, and time-to-intervention metrics.

Conclusion

We urge CMS to embrace PERS as a proven digital health solution with enormous untapped potential. It is cost-effective, deployable at scale, and trusted by patients. Integrating PERS into the broader digital infrastructure and value-based frameworks outlined in this RFI would have a profound impact on care quality and safety for Medicare beneficiaries.

We welcome the opportunity to collaborate further or provide real-world implementation examples from our members.

The ""if you build it, they will come"" approach has not produced the technology innovation CMS is looking for that makes people healthier and bends the health cost curve to a manageable rate of growth. Here are the three products CMS should build:

Product Recommendation #1. Build a Medicare Healthy Life App and make it available for free for Medicare FFS enrollees. Include diet management, exercise goals and tracking, nutrition information, social and gamification components, and possibly monetary or gift incentives. Most people lack access to powerful health improvement tools, but Medicare FFS individuals have the most limited access to a tool that is integrated with their claims, health status and coverage rules. If CMS issues an RFP to develop this product with objective engagement and lifestyle improvement objectives, industry will respond and deliver. The product should include special features for dual eligible beneficiaries (Medicare and Medicaid) and chronically ill beneficiaries as these populations require the most health management support and contribute disproportionately to preventable adverse outcomes and costs. This project could be new, or could build on the progress CMS has made with mymedicare, the Medicare Beneficiary Portal, and the Medicare coverage app. If CMS merely publishes standards and strategies and hopes the industry will ""step up,"" this initiative will not be effective.

Product Recommendation #2. Build an AI-based Clinical Decision-Support Tool to guide Medicare national and local coverage decisions, both as general policies and as a point of care tool for providers. While AI cannot replace human decision-making by clinicians, it can inform, guide and improve these decisions based on the vast amounts of claims, clinical and demographic information combined with rapidly evolving AI-powered analytics. This tool would provide the data-driven rigor needed to make high-value and effective coverage and treatment decisions. Unnecessary and ineffective tests, procedures, and pharmaceuticals not only waste resources but also lead to adverse health outcomes like medical errors and potentially dangerous medication side effects. This product would shift the American health-care system towards the 50% lower per capita health care spending levels in the U.K., Germany, Japan, Italy, and France, all countries that out-perform the U.S. in terms of health outcomes and average lifespan. 

Product Recommendation #3. End the submission of paper and PDF medical records to CMS. This is both a policy and a technology recommendation. Each year, providers and plans submit millions of medical records, hundreds of pages in length, to CMS contractors so they can review them (by flipping through physical or virtual pages) to validate, deny or correct payments. Contractors also review these records to validate the submission of quality measures from EHR systems to CMS, which have both payment and safety implications. This process costs CMS hundreds of millions of dollars annually to fund manual contractor processes and billions in costs in provider burden. Moreover, this approach traps the power of clinical data in provider EHRs by creating a massive administrative and technology barrier to accessing clinical data. Structured data files exported from EHRs (e.g., HL7/FHIR/USCDI XML or JSON formats) can be more easily transmitted by providers and analyzed instantly by CMS systems, enabling the automation of most review use cases (including pre-service, pre-pay, or post-pay) except for the small number requiring true human judgement, most commonly associated with medical necessity determinations. And for those cases, the review can still be expedited and assisted with structured data analytics. CMS could establish a date, such as January 2027, to end all paper or PDF medical record submissions and adapt a centralized system to support this change, such as the CMS Electronic Submission of Medical Data (not Documents) (esMD).

All three of these products could be prototyped and piloted as CMMI models in specific regions, or for specific populations, prior to broader expansion. This type of model work would be more pragmatic, more measurable, and potentially deliver short-term results as opposed to the current CMMI models, many of which are lengthy, complex, payment formula–based models that are difficult to manage and assess. By favoring an indirect support model over building fully functional products, many promising CMS technology initiatives have stalled, or never reached their potential, such as creating a robust BlueButton-based app ecosystem, shifting health transactions to a national HIE network, FHIR-based measure reporting, AI-based medical review and many other needle movers.

I would like seniors to have the ability to know when their identity is used to file a claim.  The recent catheter scam, where beneficiaries were hit with copayment bills for goods and services never ordered by their physician and not needed, demonstrates the vulnerability that Medicare beneficiaries have.  The reporting process for potential fraud is cumbersome and requires significant manual intervention.  

PC-9 (b)Blue Button
Blue Button can be transformed to be a sentinel for senior to warn them about potential fraud and identity theft committed in their name.  Castlestone has already designed the application to automate the Blue Button query process and use that to identify potential fraudulent claims, and provide a simple interface for seniors to confirm or deny that the claim is legitimate.  

PC-14 Digital Identity
Castlestone has developed and deployed payment network technology to verify digital identity, verify outpatient claims and use of beneficiary and provider identities.  Virtual identification cards using the digital wallet capabilities already in place.  
a)	The challenges to get patients to sign up for digital identities in the Castlestone model are minimal.  An application can be easily downloaded from a game store.  Conversely, CMS can provide a web site to download an application including a virtual ID card that can be read at any standard card network terminal.  
b)	The benefits are substantial.  CMS and beneficiaries are better protected from fraud due to identity theft.  Providers identities are protected from misuse and authorizing claims for patients they never saw.  
c)	CMS can make this available today.  It is built and fully functioning and requires no new hardware or software at the provider office. 
 
PR-10  Digital identity credentials	
Providers already have digital identities in the form of an NPI.  Use of that identity, or any other for selected transactions should require multifactor authentication.  


CB-1 incentives to encourage ACOs or those participating in Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP)
Last year’s $3 billion catheter scam was a good example of where digital technologies can protect ACOs and those participating in MSSP.  There is no authentication that the physician, part of an ACO, ever ordered catheters in their office.  Using mobile (virtual card) and payment network technology, multi-factor authentication will reduce or eliminate the misuse of beneficiary and provider identities.

I am writing to provide input on the “Health Technology Ecosystem” Request for Information (HT RFI) on behalf of an initiative focused on enabling secure, interoperable, and privacy-preserving artificial intelligence across healthcare institutions.

We have developed a federated infrastructure for AI training and digital health delivery that aligns closely with the goals of CMS and ONC. Our system is designed to support innovation in areas such as surgical robotics, AI-assisted diagnostics, and software-based therapeutics—particularly those not currently accommodated by Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) or Remote Therapeutic Monitoring (RTM) reimbursement categories.

Key Features of Our Architecture:
	•	Federated Learning: Local AI models train on-site using protected data. Encrypted updates—not raw data—are aggregated securely, preserving privacy while improving model performance.
	•	Cryptographic Identity Framework: Ensures only authorized healthcare nodes (e.g., surgical robots, EMRs, imaging devices) contribute to the learning network.
	•	Immutable Audit Trail: Participation, model contributions, and data access events are recorded transparently via distributed ledger technology to support regulatory and institutional compliance.
	•	Smart Governance Capabilities: Optional rule enforcement (e.g., data use policies, jurisdictional access controls) can be built into the system via programmable logic.
	•	Platform Agnostic: Compatible with existing EMR systems, imaging tools, robotic surgical platforms, and FDA-cleared digital devices.

This approach enables broad-scale innovation while upholding CMS’s mandates for patient privacy, data stewardship, and equity. It also lays the foundation for Medicare reimbursement of next-generation digital tools—including those covered under the proposed Prescription Digital Therapeutics (PDT) Act—by ensuring they are deployed in a secure, auditable, and interoperable framework.

Recommendation:
We respectfully urge CMS and ONC to consider:
	•	Expanding reimbursement eligibility to include AI-driven platforms that meet interoperability and privacy requirements
	•	Supporting non-centralized, privacy-preserving infrastructures like federated learning to advance access to real-time decision support and procedural intelligence
	•	Recognizing digital therapeutic systems and procedural robotics under a new class of reimbursable “interventional AI tools” within Medicare and Medicaid

We welcome the opportunity to engage further and support the national effort to modernize the healthcare technology ecosystem.

Sincerely,
Urologist

Existing apps (e.g., Medicare’s Blue Button-enabled tools, condition-specific platforms) provide basic data aggregation but lack caregiver-centric features. While apps like iBlueButton help beneficiaries access claims data, they fail to address critical gaps:
Training modules: 94% of caregivers lack formal training, yet no app integrates skill-building (e.g., wound care, dementia communication) with real-time expert feedback.
Mental health integration: Most apps omit burnout screening or connections to licensed therapists, despite caregivers facing 40-70% higher depression rates.
Task deconstruction: Complex care tasks (e.g., transitioning to assisted living) remain overwhelming; AI-driven tools to break tasks into daily checklists are rare.

PC-4: Missing Features and CMS Workflow Opportunities
a. Critical gaps in existing apps:
Gamified training platforms: Apps should reward caregivers for completing training modules (e.g., medication safety, crisis response) to address the 94% training gap. Current solutions lack adaptive learning or certification tracking.
Integrated mental health workflows: No app combines symptom tracking with automated referrals to low-cost teletherapy, despite evidence reducing caregiver depression by 37%.
Interoperable task managers: Tools to auto-populate care plans using CMS data (e.g., claims, EHRs) are missing, forcing caregivers to manually reconcile information.

a.i. Why these gaps persist:
Fragmented incentives: Developers prioritize patient-facing features over caregiver needs due to reimbursement structures.
Data silos: Lack of FHIR-enabled APIs for caregiver-specific workflows limits innovation.

b. CMS-specific workflows:
Standardized caregiver designation: Automate caregiver enrollment in EHRs during hospital discharge, triggering tailored app onboarding.
Real-time data sharing: Expand FHIR APIs to let apps pull Medicare Advantage data (e.g., ER visits) for proactive care alerts.
Cross-state licensure portals: Enable apps to connect caregivers with experts nationwide, bypassing state-specific barriers.


PC-5: Driving Adoption Through Policy and Technology
a. CMS review criteria and adoption strategies:
Certification framework: Use the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) to evaluate apps on:
Clinical impact: ≥20% reduction in caregiver burden (Zarit Burden scores).
Interoperability: Seamless integration with CMS Patient Access API.
Reimbursement incentives: Offer MA plans bonuses for covering certified apps, mirroring Diabetes Prevention Program payments.
Gamification grants: Fund apps that reward caregivers for completing training or self-care tasks.

b. Enabling timely data access:
FHIR-based push notifications: Require providers to send automated updates to apps when care plans change.
API performance standards: Penalize EHR vendors with >500ms latency for data queries.
Caregiver data permissions: Expand HIPAA’s “personal representative” rule to enable app access without manual consent

It is heartening that CMS is focusing on improving technology to empower our patients. Health care has transitioned from a paper-based system to an electronic system.  For Home Health and Hospice, we have utilized several platforms for data management including PtCT (Patient Care Technologies), HCHB (Home Care Home Base), Allscripts, EPIC (including MyChart) and SHP (Strategic Data Platforms).   Our care providers’ paperwork burden has exponentially increased with each new implementation and in response to ever increasing regulatory requirements.  The 1995 Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) had the unintended consequence of increasing charting time per patient encounter.  Additionally, data management systems typically do not interface due to proprietary constraints.  The result is a fragmented medical record that is at the very least challenging to navigate.  I do not know of any data management system that gives the patient full access to their medical records.  Imaging is one of the biggest areas of waste in our health care system.  For example, a specialist may re-order a test that was previously provided from an outside unaffiliated (unintegrated) setting.  If patients were able to have a patient friendly, cloud-based system that seamlessly integrates information, it would drastically reduce unnecessary re-entry of medical information.  Giving patients access to their complete medical record would help them more effectively navigate the maze of health care.  This would also benefit providers who would have a complete picture of the patient’s health, reduce the documentation burden and allow for more face-to-face time with patients.  The result would be reduced health care costs.  A patient friendly platform should be able to contain ALL of the patient’s medical information.  Building a platform which integrates the best characteristics of current platforms is quite a challenge, but doable especially with AI technology.  
My Medical Images is one such application that gives patients images at their fingertips and offers cloud-based technology that allows for integration into all other platforms.  Imaging is a key component in care management.  It is also an expensive part of care.  Providing patients with their images as part of a comprehensive medical record is key for successful outcomes and management of Medicare patients.

1. Overview of ChronicCare’s Mission and Services
ChronicCare is a mission-driven organization dedicated to improving outcomes and reducing the total cost of care for patients living with chronic conditions. We offer comprehensive Chronic Care Management (CCM), Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM), and Transitional Care Management (TCM) services that empower patients, providers, and payers to effectively manage chronic diseases in a scalable, data-driven, and patient-centered manner.

Our services are aligned with CMS’s value-based care goals and prioritize underserved populations, including Medicare beneficiaries, who often face barriers to access, coordination, and education.

2. Digital Health Products and Patient Empowerment
ChronicCare’s technology-enabled care model integrates biometric monitoring devices (e.g., for blood pressure, blood glucose, weight) with a user-friendly digital platform that allows patients and care teams to collaborate on personalized care plans. Our mobile apps and telehealth tools are designed to:

Provide real-time feedback and education to patients.

Facilitate remote engagement with care coordinators, nurses, and pharmacists.

Support medication adherence and lifestyle modifications through digital nudges and alerts.

Enable caregivers to stay connected and informed.

We have witnessed firsthand how the thoughtful use of digital tools can reduce hospitalizations, improve medication compliance, and increase patient satisfaction—especially among seniors who receive proactive guidance and support through our platform.

3. Health Data Interoperability and Infrastructure Gaps
A persistent challenge we encounter is the lack of seamless interoperability across EHR systems and data silos among providers, payers, and digital health vendors. ChronicCare supports federal efforts to standardize FHIR-based APIs, promote data portability, and ensure timely access to patient data for authorized stakeholders.

We strongly recommend:

Continued investment in trusted exchange frameworks and Qualified Health Information Networks (QHINs).

Mandating payer-provider data sharing for real-time medication, encounter, and care plan updates.

Funding for small practices and FQHCs to adopt and integrate CCM/RPM platforms with their EHRs.

4. Improving Digital Health Access for Medicare Beneficiaries
Many Medicare beneficiaries—especially in rural and medically underserved communities—lack the digital literacy, broadband access, or device availability to fully benefit from existing digital health products. ChronicCare addresses this by:

Providing devices (pre-configured and cellular-enabled) directly to patients.

Offering multilingual onboarding support and ongoing technical assistance.

Working with community partners (churches, senior centers, home health agencies) to bridge digital and social gaps.

Customizing outreach and education strategies to meet the cultural and cognitive needs of older adults.

We recommend that CMS expand reimbursement and incentives for digital literacy training, device distribution programs, and hybrid care models that blend tech-enabled services with high-touch care.

5. Using Data to Drive Health Equity and Policy Decisions
ChronicCare supports CMS’s goals to make more actionable data available to public health authorities, researchers, and policymakers. Our platform collects longitudinal, patient-generated data that can reveal trends in health outcomes, social determinants, and care gaps. However, we urge CMS to provide clearer guidance and funding mechanisms to:

Standardize how remote care data can be reported and shared under HIPAA-compliant frameworks.

Support analytic tools that integrate social risk factors into value-based care performance measures.

Encourage collaboration between private digital health companies and government data infrastructures.

Conclusion

The responsible adoption of digital health technologies holds immense promise for enhancing Medicare beneficiary health outcomes, driving system-wide efficiencies, and closing long-standing equity gaps. ChronicCare stands ready to partner with CMS, ONC, and other stakeholders to support the development of interoperable, patient-centered, and outcome-driven digital health infrastructure.

We welcome further dialogue and look forward to contributing to national efforts to modernize care for our most vulnerable populations.

I am writing to express my strong opposition to any federal initiatives or regulations within the proposed “Health Technology Ecosystem” that would infringe upon basic human rights—particularly the rights to medical privacy, parental authority, and bodily autonomy.

My concerns and expectations are as follows:

1. No Digital ID Requirement:
No individual should ever be required to possess or use a digital ID to access healthcare services in the United States. Healthcare is a human right and should never be conditioned upon compliance with digital identity systems.

2. Protection Against Biometric Data Mandates:
No one should be compelled to provide biometric data—such as facial recognition, fingerprints, retinal scans, or voice samples—in order to access healthcare. This is an unacceptable invasion of privacy.

3. Ban on Mandated Wearable Technology:
Under no circumstances should wearable devices be mandated for any health-related purpose. The principle of informed consent must always prevail. Any attempt to enforce wearable technology undermines personal autonomy and sets a dangerous precedent.

4. Right to Be Forgotten:
Patients must retain control over their personal health data. If artificial intelligence or other technological tools are used to collect or process data, individuals must have the right to request that such data be deleted entirely. Data collection should be opt-in, not opt-out, and subject to full transparency.

These are not radical positions—they are foundational principles of privacy, autonomy, and consent. I urge HHS to reconsider any policies or technological frameworks that would compromise these essential rights under the guise of modernization.

Primary concern is patient/parental rights to allow or deny access to information.How it is used/ stored/ accessed should be determined by patient/family.
No one should be forced to provide a digital ID.
No one should be forced to provide Biometric data.
Never mandate wearable technology on anyone for healthcare purposes.

I live in Minnesota, in the suburbs, where healthcare access is available, but your medical records are not. My wife has worked for years to enable HIE in Minnesota, but Epic hospitals refuse to cooperate, which leaves patients like me vulnerable. 

My parkinson's prevents me from working. I have memory problems related to the disease, so I am on social security and disability. Last year, I almost lost my disability benefits because we couldn't get a copy of my records from two providers' offices—Minneapolis Clinic of Neurology and Fairview Health Systems. 

We signed several forms for a copy of my records. We made numerous calls to follow up. We drove to the clinics in person and made requests. We argued with people over the phone and made complaints locally. The records never came. My wife ended up hacking the multiple MyChart accounts and retrieving PDFs, which she then sent to my email account, one page at a time. 

We were exhausted and frustrated, and I almost lost my disability benefit. 

My wife made two complaints to the ONC/ASTP information blocking website. We have never received confirmation of the submission, nor have we received any follow-up or resolution. This is fraud and misrepresentation. Why have a website if you never follow up or take any enforcement action? 

As my wife says, in Minnesota, we don't have HIE; we have Epic, and that system is tuned only to the business agendas of the local health systems, not to the needs of patients and caregivers.

Often that can be improved with physical therapy, etc. but that requires so much time off work. Either to be in a hospital setting or for follow up appointments.

The patient and their caregiver, who may have been working as well, then need FMLA paperwork filled out so they can keep their income going during this time of upheaval. 

TIMELY SUBMISSION OF FMLA PAPERWORK IS CRITICAL IN PREVENTING UNNECESSARY UNEMPLOYMENT.

When delays occur—often due to confusion over employer-specific forms, uncertainty about which provider should complete the documentation, or administrative hurdles within healthcare systems—individuals may exhaust their paid leave or be penalized for absences, ultimately risking job loss. 

Often, an independent person who is working may not have a primary care/General Provider. Once leaving the hospital, the Primary Care may not have access to the hospital records to fill out the form accurately. And hospital staff may not be able to provide it after discharge without requesting from medical records, which can cause additonal delay.

A streamlined, standardized FMLA form that can be quickly completed and signed within the Electronic Health Record would reduce these delays, ensuring that those eligible for job-protected leave can access it promptly. 

By simplifying the process, we can safeguard employment during vulnerable times and support both health and economic stability.

Please find attached our full comment in response to the Request for Information: Health Technology Ecosystem (CMS–0042–NC), Docket ID: CMS–2025–0050.

This submission reflects Salphaware’s constructive engagement with the proposed federal strategy. We offer perspective as a company actively developing hospital-aligned technologies that aim to enhance data interoperability, reduce administrative burden, and support quality reporting efforts, including in complex domains such as sepsis.

Our response shares observations regarding infrastructure readiness, suggests approaches to strengthen ethical and legal safeguards, and proposes frameworks that could help federal and private actors navigate this pivotal transformation. While our tools are still under development, they are being shaped in direct conversation with frontline hospital realities and regulatory intent.

We welcome continued engagement and are available to expand on any part of this submission.

I had medical power of attorney and was involved in my parents' care during their stay at two assisted living facilities near me. They recently passed away at the ages of 88 and 92 from complications due to dementia. I visited my parents several times a week, and took them to doctor appointments and the hospital as needed. But I didn't have easy access to their health history, so I didn't always know how to answer questions that their doctors had (and that my parents couldn't answer because they didn't remember, at this point), especially because they moved from Florida to Indiana to be closer to myself and other family members. 

When the time comes for family to care for their loved ones, there needs to be one place to go to reference that patient's health history. Even if it requires some proof of relationship and the right to do so (patient privacy is the most important thing and must be maintained).

How many patient portals must a caregiver attempt to gain access to?  What if the patient never set it up, because back when they were seen, they didn't think they needed it (or didn't know how)? Now, an aging parent with cognitive decline or other issues that prevent them from being able to complete such tasks suddenly has no health history, in effect.  

Do I need access to labs and X-rays? Probably not. But I do need summary data and names/dates. (For example, something like - Dad saw his heart doctor, Dr. Doe, on 5/1/2021 at Sarasota Memorial Hospital - so that I can convey that information, or reach out to that doctor for whatever the current doctor needs.) 

I found out near the end of her life that my mom had Pulmonary fibrosis, something that would have been helpful for me to be aware of. I only found out after a visit to the ER, where a doctor asked if I knew how long she'd had it. Lack of convenient, comprehensive healthcare information puts added stress on caregivers and puts patients at risk.  

Thank you.

Professor of Health Informatics and AI, Villanova University

1. Introduction
As an academic, international advisor, and standards committee member with decades of experience in biomedical engineering, data interoperability, and ethical AI, I commend CMS for initiating this RFI to better understand and shape the digital health landscape for Medicare beneficiaries. I appreciate the opportunity to provide input on two areas I believe are critically underrepresented in the current proposal: data provenance and metadata for device-generated health data, and the governance, surveillance, and ethical integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS).

2. Background
CMS's initiative focuses on expanding the use of EHR systems and the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) to support interoperability across providers, payors, and patients. While this is a necessary step, the current draft lacks strong articulation of how the quality and source of health data are tracked, and how advanced AI systems—already being used in many clinical contexts—will be safely governed and integrated under Medicare reimbursement structures.

3. Analysis and Gaps Identified
A. Data Provenance and Device Metadata
One of the most pressing risks in digital health data ecosystems is the ambiguity of data origin. For digital health to be trustworthy, especially in clinical decision-making and claims evaluation, CMS should require that every data point includes structured metadata identifying:

Who/what generated the data (device, provider, patient, AI, etc.)

Context of generation (setting, timestamp, credentials)

Technical specifications (e.g., device ID, last calibration date, error logs)

Such labeling is essential in remote patient monitoring (RPM), medical diagnostics, and risk scoring. Standards such as IEEE 11073 for device interoperability and IEEE 2621 for cybersecurity offer robust frameworks for metadata that CMS could require.

B. AI Governance and CDSS Oversight
Artificial Intelligence is notably absent from the proposal, despite its growing presence in diagnostics, scheduling, triage, payment reconciliation, and more. CMS must explicitly address:

Where explainable AI (XAI) is mandatory (e.g., high-risk clinical applications)

How premarket approval (PA) and especially post-market surveillance (PMS) of AI systems will be conducted

The establishment of AI Review Boards to evaluate evolving LLMs and CDSS tools under Medicare

The delineation of shared responsibility (developers, vendors, users) in the event of AI-driven adverse outcomes

CMS could leverage emerging standards such as IEEE 2802 (performance and safety of AI-based medical devices) and IEEE P2801 (quality management of datasets for AI in healthcare) to inform regulatory pathways.

4. Recommendations
Mandate standardized data provenance labeling across digital health platforms, especially for device and AI-generated data.

Incorporate AI safety, validation, and surveillance mechanisms explicitly into Medicare digital health strategy.

Establish an AI oversight body within CMS or HHS, with working groups for key AI use cases (e.g., CDSS, patient-facing apps, payment AI).

Adopt or adapt existing IEEE and ISO standards for AI and device interoperability, ensuring forward compatibility.

Encourage development of transparent metadata structures similar to DICOM for all clinically significant device data, enhancing patient safety, auditability, and claims validation.

5. Conclusion
The CMS effort is timely and well-directed, but must be broadened to ensure data trustworthiness and AI accountability. Without strong infrastructure for provenance and AI governance, digital health systems may compromise patient outcomes and system efficiency. I encourage CMS to treat AI integration and data transparency not as technical side-notes, but as core pillars of Medicare’s digital transformation.

Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to this vital initiative.

Additionally, falsified information is being used for medical decision making, correlation with test orders/results, claims/payments, quality measures, research, and AI. No other profession has this low of a standard.

Many patient records contain vast misinformation, numerous errors, deliberate omissions, and fabricated information. Why are patients blocked from writing in our records? Blocked from making direct corrections to the visit notes? Blocked from uploading documents such as test results? Blocked from accessing most components of our records, such as triage notes, workflows, and timestamps? Why can't patients directly access all areas of our records?

It is imperative that patients:

-be permitted to write directly in the visit note above or below the provider's words to ensure valid/accurate data is recorded for use in decision making, AI, research
-be permitted to upload documents such as test results or symptom logs, directly into the encounter alongside the visit note to mitigate deliberate omissions, safety mishaps, and ensure the correct information is used for clinical decision making
-be granted direct access to all areas of the records to prevent burden and minimize falsification of records
-have a mechanism to directly correct visit notes to minimize burden, medical errors, and fraud (patient correction requests are burdensome and time consuming and are routinely denied, allowing misinformation to be used in clinical decision making) 
-be able to view all CPT codes and ICD-10 codes submitted with the claim for transparency and fraud prevention
-have all transactions such as test results pushed to patient file storage rather than require queries that allow providers to alter records

There are mechanisms used at various hospitals to falsify records and alter test results and the medical records in general. Incorporating the above features will also help minimize fraud, waste, and abuse associated with the medical record vulnerabilities. These features will also promote accuracy for data used for AI, research, and patient care.

Marani Health, a digital health innovator focused on maternal and fetal care, appreciates the opportunity to provide input on CMS and ASTP/ONC’s Request for Information regarding digital health tools and health technology infrastructure.

We strongly support the Administration’s vision for a patient-centered, interoperable health technology ecosystem. We urge CMS and ONC to explicitly prioritize maternal health in its digital health strategy, and offer the following recommendations based on our work deploying prenatal monitoring technologies that serve Medicaid populations:
________________________________________
1. Enable Broader Data Access for Maternal Monitoring (PC-2, PC-9)
Our patients and providers face data fragmentation, often unable to unify pregnancy-specific clinical data (e.g., fetal heart rate, fundal height, weight gain trends) across systems. Integration of maternal and fetal data from devices and EMRs into APIs like Blue Button 2.0 would enable more holistic and timely care—especially valuable for managing high-risk pregnancies.
Recommendation: Expand API-supported data types to include pregnancy-related vitals, structured OB notes, and fetal monitoring outputs. Enable seamless third-party access through patient consent.
________________________________________
2. Prioritize Remote Monitoring in Covered Digital Health (PC-1, VB-3)
Non-invasive remote monitoring enables early detection of conditions like preeclampsia. CMS’s lack of clear support for such tools inhibits adoption by providers participating in value-based care (VBC) models.
Recommendation: Encourage or require digital maternal monitoring as part of maternity episode care bundles and APMs. Develop a CMS-reviewed list of effective tools with real-world evidence support for outcome improvement.
________________________________________
3. Promote Health Equity Through Access to Pregnancy Apps (PC-5, PC-6, VB-1)
Many underserved and rural patients lack the digital tools to navigate maternity care effectively. Navigation apps paired with monitoring can improve appointment adherence, triage support, and early complication detection.
Recommendation: Offer development incentives and reimbursement pathways for patient-facing tools designed specifically for prenatal care navigation and engagement. Address access barriers like smartphone availability, broadband gaps, and digital literacy through HHS programs.
________________________________________
4. Interoperability & Clinical Workflow Integration (PR-3, TD-4)
Maternal health data remains siloed. Providers cite challenges in integrating structured and unstructured OB data into care workflows. The result is burden and risk for patients.
Recommendation: Expand TEFCA priorities and certification standards to explicitly include obstetric/fetal monitoring data exchange. Incentivize maternal care providers' participation in health information networks and support FHIR APIs tailored to prenatal care workflows.
________________________________________
5. Real-World Data Collection to Validate Outcomes (PC-7, VB-10)
CMS can support innovation by collecting real-world data on digital maternal health tools—particularly those affecting readmissions, NICU stays, and maternal complications.
Recommendation: Establish a framework for voluntary real-world data submission on digital maternal tools and incorporate findings into future policy decisions around reimbursement and standards.
________________________________________
Closing
We urge CMS and ONC to treat maternal and perinatal health as a core test case for digital equity, interoperability, and VBC success. Marani Health is committed to collaborating with public partners to deliver the outcomes this initiative seeks.

With over 80% of U.S. physicians as registered members, we have spent 15 years building a “LinkedIn for Doctors” with HIPAA-compliant tools that reduce administrative burden. We applaud CMS for recognizing the structural inefficiencies in today’s fragmented provider data ecosystem and for taking steps toward a unified National Provider Directory and secure Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) infrastructure.

We believe physicians deserve a modern, automated solution that reflects the realities of how they practice and interact with today’s digital systems. Too often, clinicians spend valuable time updating profile information across numerous disconnected directories, a process that creates duplication, inconsistency, and ultimately frustration. These consequences lead to delayed patient access and ultimately inferior care. Currently, physicians are required to navigate a multitude of credentialing and licensing processes. Unfortunately, these sites can be poorly designed, leaving physicians uncertain about which details will remain private and which will be publicly accessible. The accessibility of physicians’ personal information online can pose significant safety problems, including identity theft and harassment. A unified provider directory built on accurate, interoperable, and machine-readable data can meaningfully reduce the resource burden in addition to promoting physician safety. 

Doximity is well positioned to contribute to this vision. Our validated, continuously updated professional network includes detailed physician information, including subspecialties, academic history, cited publications, and current employment. Profiles on the Doximity platform are the most robust digital curriculum vitae (CV) for physicians in the country. When printed, our average CV spans more than 10 pages. These profile assets support not only accurate directory listings but also trust, identity resolution, and more intuitive referral workflows. Over the last five years, we have also implemented a unified OAuth-based login system across our physician tools, enabling secure and seamless access for providers and digital health players via an API model.

We encourage CMS to continue prioritizing automation, data interoperability, and strong governance as it builds this foundational infrastructure. We will continue to support efforts that align with our core mission to make the practice of medicine easier for physicians across the country.","Other - OT001",,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

RE: Request for Information – Health Technology Ecosystem (Document Number 2025-08701)

As a federal employee supporting Medicare operations and enterprise transformation—and as the primary caregiver to a Medicare beneficiary—I appreciate the opportunity to provide input on the development of a more responsive and equitable health technology ecosystem. My professional work focuses on the alignment of business processes with modern technology strategies, including the use of artificial intelligence, automation, and data-driven tools in Medicare programs. Personally, I have witnessed how critical it is for beneficiaries to have access to technologies that support timely, independent health decisions. I respectfully offer the following comments for consideration:

1. Self-Monitoring Tools Are Essential for Medicare Beneficiaries

Medicare beneficiaries living with chronic conditions such as atrial fibrillation (Afib), hypertension, diabetes, and heart failure should be empowered to monitor their vital signs at home—without relying on a nurse or physician to perform the measurement. Access to vetted, high quality, easy-to-use tools such as blood pressure cuffs, heart rate monitors, glucometers, and pulse oximeters, along with mechanisms for directly transmitting this data to care teams in real time, is vital to early detection of complications and effective disease management.

As both a business architect and a caregiver, I believe that real-time, self-driven monitoring will reduce avoidable hospitalizations, emergency visits, and costly acute episodes, especially for beneficiaries with heart failure and/or Afib. CMS should promote coverage and integration of modern at-home monitoring tools within the Medicare program and ensure that beneficiaries receive the support and education necessary to use them effectively.

2. “Informed Health Decisions” Must Include Guidance on Where to Seek Care

The term “informed health decisions” should clearly encompass a beneficiary’s ability to assess where and when to seek care—especially for those with episodic conditions like Afib. CMS should prioritize technologies that help beneficiaries answer critical, real-time questions such as:

“Should I go to the Emergency Room or wait?”

“Is this symptom urgent or manageable?”

Accessible and easy-to-understand digital triage tools, symptom checkers, and AI-assisted care guidance should be included in the health technology ecosystem. These tools can support Medicare beneficiaries in making confident, safe, and cost-effective decisions—while also helping reduce unnecessary ER visits and improve care coordination.

3. Medication Management Tools Are Imperative for Chronic Condition Control

Medication management is a key element of chronic disease control. CMS should examine supporting technology-enabled solutions such as digital reminders, connected pill dispensers, and alerts for missed doses or potential drug interactions. These tools should be accessible to both beneficiaries and caregivers and ideally integrated with EHR and pharmacy systems to ensure real-time coordination with prescribers.

Additionally, Medicare beneficiaries should have access to secure, real-time communication with their care teams before filling or refilling high-cost prescriptions. This would help reduce the number of times beneficiaries pay hundreds of dollars for medications—particularly for heart conditions—only to later have their provider change the prescription. Avoiding these costly medication errors improves adherence and reduces avoidable health episodes.

Improved medication adherence and communication lead directly to fewer complications, hospitalizations, and ER visits—making this a high-impact area for innovation and investment within the health technology ecosystem.

4. Clear, Accessible Health Information Is Foundational to Beneficiary Empowerment
For any health technology ecosystem to truly serve Medicare beneficiaries, it must prioritize accessible, easy-to-read information about chronic condition prevention and care. Many beneficiaries struggle with health literacy, which can lead to misunderstanding diagnoses, missing important care steps, or failing to take preventive action.

CMS should ensure that digital platforms, care management tools, and educational content are:

-Written in plain language

-Available in multiple languages and accessible formats

-Visual or interactive when possible to aid comprehension

-Tailored to help beneficiaries understand how to manage their conditions day to day

When beneficiaries have clear, digestible information about their conditions—what symptoms to watch for, how to prevent complications, how to stay well—they are more likely to engage in self-care, follow provider recommendations, and avoid costly or dangerous health outcomes.

Conclusion:
This RFI seeks stakeholder input to help CMS and ASTP/ONC “build on the existing policy framework to drive large-scale adoption of health management and care navigation applications, reduce barriers to data access and exchange, realize the potential of recent innovations in healthcare that promote better health outcomes, and accelerate progress towards a patient-centric learning health system.” 

Formed in November 2023, the Accelerating Care Transformation (ACT) initiative builds on 20 years of successful collaborative work toward these same goals involving HHS (including CMS, ONC, and many other HHS agencies), VA, and many private stakeholders. ACT provides proven frameworks, methods, tools, and collaborations that can be applied to addressing – individually and collectively - many of the challenges and opportunities identified in the RFI. For example, improving patient-centered workflows and outcomes (e.g., population health, patient/care team experience, costs) within and across targets and organizations, surfacing and disseminating best practices and tools, breaking down silos and building cross-stakeholder consensus, and supporting standards-based exchange and use of computable/ interoperable data, evidence, and information management tools.  We would be happy to answer questions and further cultivate these opportunities.

In 2024, I was pregnant and in active labor in rural Minnesota. I received all of my prenatal care in Shakopee, Minnesota, though I lived 25 minutes further south. I couldn't receive care in my own city, because Mayo Clinic in April 2024 closed down the maternity services in New Prague, MN. 

I had a normal course of prenatal care, experienced gestational diabetes, and was expected to deliver a normal vaginal birth at the hospital where my OB doctor practiced in Shakopee, MN. When I started active labor, I was discouraged from entering the hospital; now I know that the hospital didn't have any beds for laboring soon-to-be new moms like me. Unfortunately, that instruction created a problem for me later because my water had broken, and I was leaking amniotic fluid, something I reported to my OB office. 

Later that day, the contractions became more frequent, and I again called for instructions. This time, I was told to drive to the hospital. However, before we could get to my car, I received a call telling us not to go to the hospital where I had planned to deliver my child. Instead, I was diverted to a Twin Cities hospital almost an hour from where I live. We got in the car and started to drive, but again, we received a call telling us that there were no beds and to go to a different hospital, this time in the southern metro suburb.

We headed to the north and anticipated that the hospital would be waiting for us. Unfortunately, we were called again, and this time, we were informed that no beds were available. We were diverted a fourth time, and this time to a critical access hospital that is 1 hour south of the Twin Cities and to the south and east of where we live in Southwest Minnesota. We were told to go to Northfield, Minnesota.

My doctors didn't practice at this hospital, nor did they have privileges at any other hospitals except the original one. In Minnesota, our medical records don't follow us, and there is no record of me ever having been seen at Northfield Hospital. The lack of infrastructure in Minnesota puts me and my baby at risk, and the lack of beds and rural maternal child care for pregnant moms puts 10% of all births in Minnesota in jeopardy of a bad outcome. 

I am submitting this comment because the state of Minnesota needs help, and there needs to be protections for patients like me who have no control over where we end up delivering our babies. The doctors, staff, and employees of Northfield had no way to know what my prenatal care looked like or who I was, or what special care I may or may not need. 

Rural maternal care and connected health records are a fundamental right.

I realized I did not separate out the below paragraphs. This point may be more of a longer term goal.

CMS and ASTP/ONC should explicitly include care delivery organizations (CDOs)—including those structured as independent physician associations (IPAs) or affiliated with payers—within the definition of “providers” required to adopt API-enabled Certified EHR Technology (CEHRT). This inclusion is essential to reflect the reality of evolving healthcare delivery models, enhance interoperability, and ensure patients and consumers have consistent access to their electronic health information.
CMS should also require all CDOs submitting data to CMS—particularly for programs such as quality reporting, value-based care, and risk adjustment—to use CEHRT with robust support for both CDA and FHIR APIs. To reduce reliance on PDFs and manual processes, CMS should accelerate the transition to FHIR-based submission workflows by providing clear implementation guides and financial incentives. These actions will improve data timeliness, accuracy, and patient outcomes.

FHIR and CDA education should be done to flow from the parent organizations of provider health systems and payer-affiliated care delivery organizations down to frontline staff, including insurance verification specialists and certified medical assistants. Ensuring that all levels of clinical and administrative personnel are knowledgeable about interoperability standards is critical to successful implementation, data accuracy, and improving patient care coordination.","Individual",,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Do you have easy access to your own health information in one location?

No. Obtaining records is unnecessarily burdensome or not possible. The available patient portals block access to many areas of the records. I am required to fill out burdensome forms to ask permission from health care organizations to obtain my own records, and sometimes they never send them. Please revise the patient user login profile requirements to enable patient access to all areas of the records. There should NOT be separate systems for providers and patients to access medical records.

b. If not, in what contexts or for what workflows would it be most valuable to use one portal or system to access all such health information? 

I would greatly benefit from access to the system that stores the radiology images. It is very difficult to get the complete set of images that I want to share with other providers or family members. There should NOT be separate systems for providers and patients to access radiology imaging studies. Patients should not be required to request permission from anyone to obtain their records, fill out forms to obtain records, or jump through hoops to get them. Additionally, the raw images should be automatically released to the patient as soon as they are captured, before the patient leaves the testing site.

c. Were there particular data types, such as x-rays or specific test results, that were unavailable? 

•	I cannot access the Epic Care Everywhere feature to monitor for accuracy the information being shared among multiple organizations, which is often different that the information visible to me in my record. This is a violation of my HIPAA rights.
•	I’ve discovered some organizations have 2 different versions of the visit notes, but I can only access one version. The accessible version often contains minimal information but the detailed version of the visit note is inaccessible to me. This is a violation of my HIPAA rights.
•	I cannot access my original EKG reports. Sometimes the original EKG reports are available but overwritten with a vague conclusion. The EKG test facilitator prints a copy of the EKG report at the testing site for the provider, but I am not permitted to have a printed copy myself even though it takes 2 seconds to print the extra copy. Sometimes it takes weeks for the EKG report to be released on the portal, and still then, often the original EKG report output is overwritten by a provider’s conclusion or a vague statement that masks the original results. It is best practice to add an interpretation but preserve the original automated output.
•	I cannot access other test results, such as an endoscopy reports.
•	I cannot access diagnoses used for claims and clinical decision making.
•	I cannot access radiology imaging orders to monitor the accuracy of the reason for the study indicated on the order, but the reason determines the testing protocol and guides the interpretation of the results.
•	I cannot access radiology images. When the image studies are provided, components of the image results are blocked, require a password to access certain images through links, or removed from the study results altogether.
•	I cannot access the logs to see who edited test results and other record information, who shared my information, where it was shared, and who received it.
•	I cannot view the clinical decision tools, profiles, and scores that impact the care I receive.

Again, there should not be ‘separate systems’ of access for patients and providers. I should be able to obtain and monitor all information in my chart including all information used in clinical decision making or for other reasons. I am the only person looking out for my safety and accordingly, should have access to everything.

Yes, I can attach 20 documents and multiple screenshots, but it is obviously useless: you are determined to exterminate humanity and protect satanic medical mafia. It is unclear why you want the name and contact info. CMS is correct in advising to provide specific examples and I have mountain of them, but what for?

CMS-0042-NC. CMS Building Foundational Infrastructure for Digital Healthcare Ecosystem
You are ALREADY building it, so that the survey is a dog and pony show by default. You are already decided that this anti-human outrage is going to take place – all seniors without electronics be damned. I don’t have ANY electronics and use library computers to type this text surrounded by noisy savages and I am not a native speaker. Your form does not even bother to include grammar correction. I am embarrassed to find mistakes later on – do not have time now.

I have very few documents on me pertaining to medical fraud/CMS on my flash drive in the library. Ultimately, I am not nearly ready to send my comments, but running out of time. The bottom line is iron clad and will never change in this lifetime or another: anyone whatsoever peddling more electronics is enemy of humanity. No if, no maybe. None of your demagogue and brainwashing why integrating alien technology improves human lives makes a slightest dent. When you are an adult, you no longer believe in Santa, right? Same here: you can stand on your heads all you want and you can exterminate us, seniors, just the same as Nazi did, but you are not going to convince anyone with half brain that spying technology improves health.

I will explain a few things randomly here and there (unedited): 

The main thief in AZ is DES joined by the hips with AHCCCS (Medicaid). In 2014, these other enemies of humanity demanded recertification by phone only (which I don’t have) and thus unlawfully cancelled my miserable food stamps. I am on min SSI available in the USA, currently $967 and nothing else – tell me more about “Golden Age”, “America is back”, “Eggs 61% down” BS (not one penny cheaper, of course), etc. If this government is so blatantly genocidal judging by 666 parameters including non-survivable SSI, then anything by any Agency is also genocidal by default. Especially such pure Satanism like more electronics down everyone’s throat.

In mid 90s, one CFR shill came on TV to talk to another CFR shill, Charlie Rose, and said that their main goal is to exterminate elderly. The seniors would not be able to follow up on various electronic devices and Internet platforms, learn any of these with ever-increasing speed (think countless scanners in stores), and thus will be left out unable to participate in life. On a side note: one of my diplomas was in radio engendering. I taught student how to use common household electronics made by humans. But blatantly alien iThings are not the same as electronics used to be.

Back to AHCCCS, which assumed that I am now rich and would lose their non-existent services so they unlawfully connected my good name to satanic evil “Mental health”, labeled me SMI (I have 3 diplomas, was a theater director, etc.) as if I suffered from such non-existent fraud – this does not require financial qualification. Up until this day, this bloody scum refuses to let me out of this SMI causing total lack of social life as we know it, unimaginable physical and emotional pain and suffering, and much more while worthless CMS ignored all my pleas for help.

In 2020, I turned 65, received all papers necessary to get Medicare and got nothing: CALL or DIE. At the end of the year I got the Lifeline (free) telephone and signed up for UnitedDeathcare under condition that I don’t need PCP recommendation to see the specialists vs evil AHCCCS demanding worthless appointments with PCP and never allowing anything else. I tried multiple parasites called “doctors”, spent 7 hours on the phone trying to get to PCP and did not make it through their “customer care” if you excuse my language. Only later I realized that this was not because they don’t have enough staff, but to ram most sickening “music” down everyone’s brains and force to keep deadly-radiation alien device close to head at all times. The music was satanically loud while if anyone would respond, I would not hear that.

A few appointments that I got in 2021 by knocking to the doors in person were totally useless and all scumbags overcharged me despite my Plan covers everything: no deductibles.

A patient-controlled global medical record is needed that automatically preserves the original record including test results. Patients are in a unique position to collate all their medical records in one place. The app should allow connection to any EHR or app the patient chooses, and any new information generated by external health care organizations-especially EHRs-should be pushed to the patients' global record account automatically.

Audit features in EHRs do not protect patients. Many health organizations change the records, including test results and claims diagnosis, after it is discovered the patient had a serious problem or dies, but wasn't given appropriate medical care. The record is recreated to make it look like the providers did things right when in reality, they ignored the patient's obvious signs. Old EHRs or old EHR software configurations that lack audit features still in use are used to alter the medical record then imported back into the newer EHR. Fixing this problem would promote patient safety and therefore reduce costs, and prevent fraud. The system currently in place incentivizes poor quality of care because providers know the records can be altered later if something bad happens to the patient.","Individual - I0001",,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

This aligns with the CMS burden reduction agenda, promotes efficient EHR use, and enhances nursing contributions to team-based, high-quality care.

1. Streamlines and Standardizes Documentation
•	With standardized codes and concepts for common nursing problems, goals, and interventions, nurses spend less time searching for or free-texting terms in EHRs.
•	Drop-downs, templates, and clinical decision support (CDS) can be pre-populated with ICNP-SNOMED CT terms, making documentation faster and more intuitive.

2. Reduces Redundant Data Entry
•	Structured nursing data can be reused across workflows (e.g., care plans, quality reporting, shift handoffs), minimizing the need to re-document the same information in multiple places.
•	It supports interoperable reuse, meaning data collected in one system can auto-populate or sync with another, which is crucial for home health, post-acute, or long-term care nurses.
3. Enables More Intelligent EHR Interfaces
•	ICNP-SNOMED CT-coded data enables smarter, context-aware clinical decision support, nudging nurses toward evidence-based actions without adding extra documentation tasks.
•	Over time, this could allow automation of routine documentation (e.g., “standard fall precautions initiated”) based on clinical context.

4. Improves Team Communication Without Extra Charting
•	Standardized terminology allows other team members (physicians, care managers, social workers) to better understand and act on nursing documentation.
•	This reduces follow-up calls, notes, and redundant communication tasks that often fall on nurses.

5. Reduces Burden of Quality Reporting and Audits
•	Structured, coded data supports automated reporting for quality measures (e.g., pressure ulcer prevention, mobility), reducing the burden of manual chart review or retroactive coding.
•	This helps nurses spend more time on direct patient care instead of audit preparation.

Rainfall Health’s AI platform reduces provider burden by automating compliance monitoring, standardizing workflows, and transforming raw data into actionable insights that align with CMS quality and reimbursement models. Our solution supports PR-7 and PR-8 by streamlining clinical data responsibilities and guiding both providers and payers through shared, metrics-driven workflows. For Health Systems that are worried about the burden of additional compliance and reporting, this is a technological advancement that brings down time to readiness to under 10 days for mandated models.

We urge CMS to prioritize partnerships with vendors that:

- Deliver real-time, mandate-aligned data, in a standardized format for transparency of planning and allocation of resources

- Leverage AI to make compliance and quality easy to track and report

- Enable seamless interoperability without disrupting existing EMR systems.

Thank you for the opportunity to respond to this request for information. I am a board certified pathologist, and I spent the last ten years of my career before retirement as a medical officer in the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) in the Department of Health and Human Services. Prior to my work at ASPE I was at CMS where I worked on the Doctors Office Quality Information Technology Project and its continuation through the Quality Improvement Organization’s 8th scope of work. Based on this experience, our health technology ecosystem is limited in its performance for the following reasons.

First, it does not consider the tremendous complexity of diagnosing and treating the numerous disease combinations found in Medicare patients. While at ASPE I had access to a comprehensive database of Medicare claims data as well as extensive access to analytical tools and statisticians. The central finding of this research is that patients are surprisingly unique in their medical histories even at the national level. For example, the most complex 35% of Medicare patients account for approximately 80% of Medicare expenditures, and the national cell size of patients with similar disease combinations in this group is approximately 5 individuals. Each of these distinct combinations is small and scattered across the nation. One way to view this statistical fact is that patients with one of the many combinations of multiple diagnosis would fall into a patient cluster size that meets the requirements for classification as a rare disease. Thus, multiple comorbid patients face the same challenges as a patient with a single rare disease. Notably, even the largest healthcare systems do not have access to enough patient data to form useful datasets for artificial intelligence (AI) training or to perform clinical trials on these numerous small clusters of complex patients.

Secondly, it fails to incentivize the sharing of patient data required to train and validate the numerous applications of AI needed to improve patient care. AI training requires access to large high quality data sets. Given the extraordinary variability of humans and the resultant complexities found in all aspects of patient care, it is crucial that the current state of the art of clinical data be improved if we are to maximize the benefit of AI. In many ways it is unclear how accurate our data sets are, and the ability to aggregate them and share them with appropriate privacy and security protections needs improvement.

Thirdly, it fails to improve the accuracy and timeliness of the diagnostic process and thus reduce diagnostic errors.  Indeed, health care organizations are rewarded financially for unnecessary testing that may delay and complicate the patient’s treatment. Contributing to this issue is that providers have access to clinical laboratories with thousands of different tests to choose from, and an ever growing variety of new tests are becoming available. There is a similar explosion in new imaging modalities. No individual human can keep up with this level of complexity, and it is clear that new solutions are needed at every step from test selection through test result interpretation. This will require significant advances in the application of AI as well as significant organizational changes to the diagnostic branches of healthcare. Examples of these changes would include the national adoption of digital pathology, greater integration of pathology and radiology services, and the formation of diagnostic management teams to help providers care for specific patients.

Fourthly, it does not adequately incentivize the development and adoption of advanced diagnostic technologies. We are witnessing a renaissance in the development of new diagnostic tests (genetic, cell phone data etc.) many of which extend into the patient’s home and working environments. Again, our current health technology ecosystem is proving slow to integrate these technologies and provide an optimal environment for establishing their utility or lack thereof.

Finally, there is an overreliance on highly centralized quality improvement and measurement strategies that fail to account for the high level of variation and complexity found in human disease. To correct this deficiency, the future health technology ecosystem must support the sharing of data and knowledge needed to treat the numerous small patient clusters that are found nationally.

To further address these issues, please read the following peer reviewed paper describing how a new national marketplace based on data and knowledge sharing can be developed that meets the actual needs of providers when caring for a specific complex patient.

Premier Inc. appreciates the opportunity to submit comments to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy/Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ASTP/ONC) on opportunities to improve data interoperability and the broader health technology infrastructure for all stakeholders. Premier supports the Administration’s efforts to empower patients through the effective and responsible adoption of technology in healthcare. In our detailed comments below, Premier specifically recommends that CMS focus on the following:

•	Harmonizing interoperability regulations to promote greater market competition;
•	Updating meaningful use criteria, certification standards for health IT and the overall federally-driven interoperability incentive structure to ensure that data usability for quality and process improvement are adequately incentivized;
•	Clearly defining information blocking and implementing and enforcing more stringent information blocking penalties on health data ecosystem participants beyond providers and provider organizations;
•	Extending interoperable electronic health record incentives to post-acute and continuum of care providers;
•	Developing a holistic framework of both financial and non-financial incentives to promote value-based care participation, which in turn results in greater adoption of tech-enabled solutions; 
•	Mandating a patient-directed data sharing mechanism such as Blue Button 2.0 in certified electronic health record technology (CEHRT) criteria;
•	Requiring more standardized data sharing by CMS-regulated health plans to providers and patients; and
•	Improving Risk Adjustment Data Validation (RADV) audit processes by piloting a program that relies on CMS-approved, real-time self-audit technology rather than perpetuating a pay-and-chase model.

Our recommendations are discussed in greater detail in the attachment. Premier looks forward to continuing to work with CMS and ASTP/ONC on implementing these recommendations to unleash innovation and improve efficiency in healthcare delivery.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2025-0050-0287/attachment_1.pdf","pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Rune Labs strongly supports this objective and offers the following key points drawn from our work with StrivePD - the leading digital management platform for Parkinson’s disease (PD):

1. Passive, consumer‑grade sensors meaningfully reduce acute‑care utilization. In a Kaiser Permanente pilot, StrivePD users experienced a 42 % reduction in emergency‑department visits compared with matched controls. We encourage CMS to recognize such digital biomarkers as legitimate measures for Alternative Payment Models (APMs) and expand Remote Therapeutic Monitoring (RTM) codes beyond musculoskeletal use cases.

2. API‑first data exchange should explicitly include Patient‑Generated Health Data (PGHD). StrivePD’s Apple HealthKit pipeline already produces FHIR resources that can flow into Blue Button 2.0. CMS should add PGHD to USCDI v4 and require Qualified Health Information Networks (QHINs) to support those data classes.

3. Digital identity rules must preserve consumer‑friendly sign‑on methods. Medicare Beneficiary Identifiers (MBIs) and NIST IAL2/AAL2 requirements should allow third‑party authenticators such as Apple ID to avoid disenfranchising older beneficiaries.

4. Value‑Based Care models need timely, device‑collected outcomes. Continuous gait‑quality and mobility metrics captured by smartphones detect progression 3–6 months earlier than in‑clinic scales; CMS should pilot such measures in the Innovation Center’s forthcoming neuro‑degenerative VBC models.

5. Early engagement with specialty‑specific digital platforms de‑risks TEFCA adoption. Requiring QHIN‑level certification for PGHD exchange without clear transition funding would stall innovation; we propose a phased glide path tied to public–private testbeds.

We provided detailed evidence, recommendations, and implementation considerations in the PDF attached. We stand ready to serve as a real‑world test case as CMS and ONC operationalize the policies outlined in this RFI.

Tendo appreciates the opportunity to provide feedback to CMS/HHS 

In operating a national healthcare marketplace serving self-insured employers, we have consistently observed that informed patients and navigators make value-driven decisions when they can compare cost, quality, and convenience. Enabling this transparency creates healthy market competition, drives efficiency, and reduces overall healthcare costs.

The RFI, particularly in Section PC-12a(1-5), highlights critical use cases such as “finding the right provider,” access to “binding costs,” and visibility into “quality metrics.” These goals directly align with building a shoppable healthcare experience—one that allows patients to see the total cost of an episode of care and compare provider quality in a meaningful, procedure-specific way.

Section TD-19 highlights the current limitations of price transparency. We believe the next policy evolution is to make this transparency actionable—enabling patients to not only compare options but also purchase care directly. In other words, to treat healthcare like e-commerce.

Furthermore, Sections VB-2 and VB-10 emphasize the need for technology that supports clinical quality measurement, risk adjustment, and value-based models like episode-of-care bundles. These goals are best served by platforms that streamline care delivery and payment through bundled, pre-negotiated, and quality-assured offerings.

We strongly encourage CMS to explore and support models that enable this level of consumer engagement and simplification. A marketplace built on transparent binding costs, useful quality metrics, and seamless e-commerce workflows can help modernize Medicare, expand patient choice, and improve affordability through natural market dynamics and incentivizing efficiency.","Health Care Industry - PI015",,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2025-0050-0295/attachment_1.docx,https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2025-0050-0295/attachment_1.pdf","pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I am writing to express our concerns as they relate to the request for information from HHS surrounding the ""Health Technology Ecosystem"" and what impact this will have on the liberties and freedoms of all Americans. In my personal capacity, during the recently ended Idaho legislative session, I drafted and helped to pass the IDAHO MEDICAL FREEDOM ACT which bans nearly all mandates for the state of Idaho. I did this because I am deeply passionate about civil liberties especially surrounding issues of health.

DIGITAL ID
HHS has put out a request for information at the following link:
https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/05/16/2025-08701/request-for-information-health-technology-ecosystem

Under 3b & d in the Digital Identity section, HHS poses the following question, ""Regarding digital identity credentials ... What impact would mandatory credentials have on a nationwide provider directory?"" HFDF and I are resolute in our conviction that digital identity must never be a requirement to access healthcare for any American citizen. The entire program should be an opt-in program barring mandates of any kind. However, should the system come to pass, then HHS must provide a valid mechanism to opt-out of such a digital ID requirement without impacting the type or quality of healthcare available to every individual.

BIOMETRICS
Implicit in the questions HHS raises surrounding digital identity is what biometric data requirements will be implemented. Again, HFDF stands staunchly opposed to any biometric data requirement for any American to access healthcare and should such requirements come to pass, there MUST be permanent valid op-outs without impacting the type or quality of healthcare provided.

WEARABLES
When it comes to wearable technology every American should have the right to decide whether to utilize such technology or not. The IDAHO MEDICAL FREEDOM ACT explicitly prohibits any private or state actor from requiring a medical interventions or requirements including devices and wearables in order to lead a normal life. It is a little-known fact that in 2018 the state of West Virginia attempted to require all teachers to wear Fitbits to access medical insurance. The teachers rose up in what became a historic strike and this requirement was abolished. The attempt by authorities to impose such a requirement illustrates that some stakeholders take no issue with mandating wearable technology. This morally repugnant stance implies that human beings are nothing more than livestock to be tagged and must never be tolerated in America, a nation that values human dignity and the value of every individual. A West Virginian teacher discusses this issue at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa9MVP5aMdQ

The ""right to be forgotten""
With the rise of AI and data being viewed as ""the new oil,"" some European nations have placed value on a concept known as ""the right to be forgotten."" If a patient receives medical care from a doctor or provider who is using AI tools, the patient has the right to determine whether their information is saved in a database or deleted permanently.

We commend the agencies’ focus on improving digital health infrastructure and encourage the inclusion of maternal mental health (MMH) as a key priority throughout the digital health policy landscape.  Digital health tools play a critical role in improving maternal mental health outcomes and addressing the maternal morbidity and mortality crisis in the United States. Mental health, including suicide and overdose, is a leading cause of maternal mortality in the U.S. and globally. Suicide remains the leading cause of direct maternal deaths in the first postnatal year, often occurring during the second half of that year. Maternal mental health conditions—such as perinatal depression, anxiety, and postpartum psychosis—not only represent some of the most common complications of pregnancy and childbirth, but also significantly increase the risk of suicide. Digital innovations present unique opportunities to bridge care gaps, especially for underserved and remote populations. One such approach is collaborative care—a team-based model that integrates mental health services into primary and obstetric care through shared care plans, regular case reviews, and measurement-based treatment. This model improves screening, diagnosis, and access to timely treatment, and when paired with digital tools, can further expand reach and reduce stigma by connecting patients to care in convenient, low-barrier settings.
MMHLA’s Technology Council serves as a strategic forum for technology companies in the maternal mental health space to partner in advancing education, awareness, and policy solutions that support the mental health of mothers and childbearing people across the United States. Through this Council, MMHLA is building partnerships, developing strategies, and expanding organizational capacity to strengthen the digital maternal mental health ecosystem. By fostering collaboration with innovators in digital health, MMHLA aims to improve the effectiveness and reach of tools that support maternal mental health screening, treatment, and ongoing care. These efforts align with the broader federal focus on health technology infrastructure, including recent initiatives such as CMS and ASTP/ONC’s request for information on digital health tools for Medicare beneficiaries. Effective and responsible adoption of digital tools can empower patients to make better-informed decisions, improve access to care, and expand data availability for stakeholders working to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality. MMHLA and its partners are committed to shaping a future in which all mothers and birthing people have equitable access to high-quality digital mental health care.

Digital platforms and telehealth services can provide timely access to mental health screenings, interventions, and follow-up care regardless of geographical or logistical barriers. This is especially crucial given the shortage of perinatal mental health providers nationwide and the frequent lack of coordinated behavioral health support in obstetric and primary care settings. Moreover, integrating these tools into electronic health records and making screening results interoperable allows for better monitoring, referrals, and follow-up, leading to more comprehensive, patient-centered care.

Beyond access, digital tools can reduce stigma by offering anonymous symptom tracking, peer support communities, and culturally relevant education. These capabilities encourage individuals who may otherwise be reluctant to seek help to engage earlier and more consistently. Furthermore, digital health applications and provider directories can empower patients with actionable information to make informed choices, increasing self-efficacy and engagement in their care.

The inclusion of maternal mental health functionality in national health IT standards and CMS-supported tools will also support data-driven decision-making. By capturing maternal mental health metrics, CMS can better understand patient needs, identify service gaps, and design responsive quality improvement initiatives.

Incorporating maternal mental health into the broader digital health ecosystem should not be optional—as it is essential to reversing the alarming rise in maternal mortality, particularly due to mental health complications and substance use. Digital health innovation is a cost-effective, scalable, and urgently needed solution to ensure every birthing person receives timely, equitable, and evidence-based care.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the CMS RFI related to Information Blocking and the implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act. I am writing to strongly recommend that CMS enhance the current requirement for publishing a practice’s service base URL to also include a complete listing of all associated providers at the National Provider Identifier (NPI) level.

The current requirement, while a meaningful step forward, does not sufficiently support patients in identifying or accessing health information tied to a specific provider involved in their care. In large or multi-specialty organizations, patients often receive treatment from a wide range of professionals under a single practice or facility umbrella. Simply publishing the practice-level URL obscures the link between an individual provider and the patient’s health data, thereby weakening the spirit of patient-directed interoperability that the Cures Act aims to promote.

By requiring the inclusion of NPI-level detail alongside the base URL, patients will be empowered to direct their health information requests to the exact provider on record for their care. This refinement would help eliminate confusion, minimize delays, and ensure a more streamlined and transparent process for patients seeking to aggregate or share their medical history, especially in scenarios involving second opinions, transitions of care, or participation in clinical research.

Moreover, this enhancement would reinforce the accountability of each Provider Actor as defined by the Cures Act. By publicly associating their NPI with a service base URL, providers are reminded of their individual responsibility to enable access, exchange, and use of electronic health information in a timely and complete manner. In practice, this could reduce instances of unintentional or deliberate information blocking at the individual level, promote better compliance, and enhance auditability.

In short, expanding this requirement is not merely a technical improvement, it is a patient-centric policy refinement that aligns with the broader goals of the Cures Act: advancing transparency, access, and patient autonomy. I urge CMS to consider this enhancement as part of the ongoing rulemaking process and to collaborate with ONC to ensure consistency across regulatory frameworks.

Our mission is to build infrastructure that supports meaningful digital health innovation by ensuring patient-controlled, seamless, and secure data exchange.

In our comment on CMS-0042, we outlined several recommendations grounded in this operational experience. We urged CMS to strengthen implementation quality and enforcement mechanisms for Patient Access APIs, address current fragmentation in digital identity systems, and modernize the Blue Button 2.0 API to bring Traditional Medicare into alignment with Medicare Advantage. We highlighted gaps in current payer API implementations—including missing or inconsistent USCDI elements—and called for rigorous conformance testing, machine-readable validation, and public audits tied to financial incentives. We also recommended API-based EHI export and support for high-assurance digital identity credentials like Login.gov, which would reduce patient login friction, improve fraud monitoring, and increase adoption across the ecosystem.

We also called attention to payer behaviors that mirror information blocking—such as opaque developer registration processes, unresponsive support, and arbitrary rate limits—which remain unaddressed due to current regulatory scope. We urged CMS to extend information blocking provisions to payers and invest in education for payer staff who often lack the knowledge to support patient-directed access. Our letter advocates for hybrid infrastructure models that allow both direct and shared-network connectivity, creating a level playing field for developers and improving data consistency. Flexpa is committed to partnering with CMS and the broader healthcare ecosystem to advance patient access and unlock the full potential of interoperable health data.","Private Industry - Health Care",,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2025-0050-0328/attachment_1.pdf","pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the provided questions on how CMS and HHS can make healthcare access and technology more effective. Years of rulemaking and incentives for open access to healthcare information have not solved the problem of patients lacking consistent and easy access to their records. Confusing hurdles force many patients to give up.
Despite the poor progress on open access technology, the overall digitization of healthcare has sped up with providers and payors spending records amounts of money on digital services that don’t follow open standards, create data silos, and create waste and friction. This has also resulted in patients losing control of their data and how it’s used.
CMS and HHS must ensure open documentation and free availability of foundational healthcare frameworks and give patients and their families control over their records.

FMLA and ADA forms on FHIR
To improve the efficiency, consistency, and interoperability of medical certifications under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), CMS should work with the Department of Labor (DOL), ONC, and standards organizations to digitize the FMLA process using open health data standards such as FHIR and  openEHR.
FMLA certification forms (e.g., WH-380 series) currently rely on manual, paper-based workflows that burden clinicians, delay patients' access to job-protected leave, and create administrative overhead for employers. By leveraging HL7 FHIR resources such as Condition, CarePlan, Practitioner, and DocumentReference, the clinical portions of the forms can be automated and exchanged directly from certified EHRs. Additionally, openEHR’s archetype-based approach offers a robust model for long-term storage, computability, and data validation, particularly for complex use cases such as intermittent leave or chronic conditions.
FHIR can support real-time generation and sharing of required certification data through SMART on FHIR apps, while openEHR templates can serve as durable, version-controlled clinical models aligned with existing documentation standards. Integrating these approaches would reduce clinician burnout, speed up patient access to leave, and improve data quality for oversight and policy analysis.
CMS should consider pilot programs or interagency collaborations to:
•	Define a standardized FMLA Questionnaire/QuestionnaireResponse using FHIR
•	Promote the use of openEHR templates for clinical certification of medical necessity
•	Engage EHR vendors and employers to implement interoperable, standards-based workflows
•	Ensure patient and employee data rights are preserved during electronic exchange
CMS should engage leave management vendors stakeholders such as Sedgwick, ReedGroup, Unum, AbsenceSoft, and Matrix Absence Management. These vendors process millions of FMLA and ADA claims each year on behalf of employers and already interact with healthcare providers. Supporting their adoption of FHIR APIs for intake of clinical certification data would align with CMS’s goals of reducing burden and improving coordination across sectors. The ASTP/ONC and HL7 International should also engage leave management vendors as stakeholders to do FHIR API based exchange.

CMS, researchers, experts, and commenters are losing sight of the forest for the trees.

Despite seamless integration, team-based, patient-centric, value-based, quality improvement, incentivized, digitized, standardized, outcome focused, accessible, burden reduction, patient experience, interoperability, care coordination, social determinants of health, innovation, transformation, leveraging, and technologically enhanced initiatives, many struggle to obtain basic medical care. 

Do the ‘experts’ have secret health care systems? Because It seems like everyone talks about these things but few are doing them.

***To prevent chronic illness, we need our providers to diagnose us in a timely manner.***

Yet, this is often unobtainable. And for reasons unrelated to insurance. It would be helpful to have an app (not owned by the medical provider) such as ChatGPT that is integrated into the EHR. The patient would enter their symptoms, and AI would correlate with the patient's history to output a list of differential diagnoses and next steps such as testing. This output would be captured into the visit note. This would be highly beneficial and help prevent chronic illness because it would facilitate timely and accurate diagnosis.

The health IT ecosystem seems to be building on the existing dysfunction. This might be one of the few circumstances where it might be better to simply reinvent the wheel. Create a centralized patient record into which all information feeds and is managed. 

Please work to understand patient needs. Read some social media posts to learn what the average care-seeking patient goes through merely to obtain basic medical care. Understand that our health systems often create chronic illness, yet efforts to prevent this seem to be directed mostly at the patient. Our stories often sound nothing like what is being offered by the commenters and existing systems overall.

An app that allows me to add corrections directly to the providers note is very much needed to prevent medical errors and chronic illness. Even to obtain basic medical treatment. 

It's impossible to have an accurate medical record. My record is so inaccurate that it seems to be about someone else. When I ask for corrections,  they are usually denied even when I have proof. Or I hear no response about it at all. At the most, I am permitted to add a statement that gets buried in some obscure part of the record that no one reads. And it takes months to get it added. 

Better yet, just let the patient add reason for the visit and symptoms and any test results directly to the provider's note. This would help ensure i receive quality care.

I think this capability doesn't exist because the records are set up with intentional errors. Because if the real information was there, the doctor might be questioned for not providing the standard of care. In other words, doctors would be incentives to do their job.","Individual",,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

To achieve “the promise of radical transparency” and usability in healthcare data and ensure individuals “have the information they need to make well-informed healthcare decisions.” We propose the following opportunities:
1.	Resolve information blocking. 
a.	Allow digital health products to use the “High Confidence” Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) and Authenticator Assurance Level 2 (AAL2) (NIST SP 800-63-3) processes to access Clearinghouse, Blue Button 2.0 and QHIN clinical data in multiple ways.  
i.	A BAA should not be required with a Covered Entity for an IAS. 
ii.	Digital Health Products should be able to use IAL2 and AAL2 service which is developed and managed internally or from any suitable vendor and not only the six certified Credential Service Providers. 
iii.	Instead of requiring individual login and password credentials, as with Blue Button 2.0 and other Payer Patient Access APIs, allow bulk access to the data using demographics gathered from the IAL2 process. 
b.	Reconsider the Common Agreement for Trusted Exchange Framework.  A contract in this scenario may be limiting possible networks, participants and sub-participants from joining.  Decreased management of this contract process would lead to cost reduction.  
c.	Encourage and incentivize participation of Covered Entities in the Trusted Exchange Framework Common Agreement (TEFCA) Qualified Health Information Network (QHIN). 
d.	Penalize TEFCA QHIN participants and subparticipants who do not return data for the currently required exchange purposes of Treatment (T-TREAT) and Individual Access Services (T-IAS).  
e.	Access to QHIN Directory remains limited to RCE and QHINs but should be made public as soon as possible. 
f.	Create a modified version of TEFCA for Individual Access Services with terms that recognize the generation of queries with a patient’s consent, invoking FTC Act and the Health Breach Notification Rule obligations instead of HIPAA.
g.	Ensure all data queried is returned without geofencing. 
h.	Ensure the availability of complete price information in a standard data format for clinical products and services to patients prior to encounters and order fulfillment that is easy to access and comprehend. 
2.	Ensure the “Patients over Paperwork” commitment to “cut the red tape” and “…allow providers to concentrate on their primary mission: improving health outcomes”. 
a.	Allow digital health products to facilitate patients’ access to ASC X12 Version 5010 transaction data through HETS and other clearinghouses without the necessity of a provider’s credentials.  
b.	Remove the HETS provider affidavit requirement for ASC X12 Version 5010 transactions.
c.	Allow bulk ASC X12 Version 5010 transactions requested by digital products on behalf of patients without requiring provider credentials.   
3.	Advance Standards more quickly. 
a.	Advance the other exchange purposes (XPs) from the TEFCA Standard Operating procedure V.3 August 6, 2024 quickly. 
b.	Regarding the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI):
i.	Review the Standards Version Advancement Process (SVAP) for any concerns and if none, promote the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) to the current approved version, 5.  
ii.	Reinstate the Health Information Technology Advisory Board to continue advancing USCDI. 
iii.	Review and approve new versions of USCDI faster, at least quarterly. 
iv.	Incorporate more data classes and elements in USCDI versions.
c.	Incentivize QHIN and other health information networks for end-to-end FHIR exchange for quicker implementation. 
d.	Maintain the January 1, 2027 requirement for the CMS Interoperability and Prior Authorization Rule (CMS-0057-F)

What specific opportunities and challenges exist to improve accessibility, interoperability and integration of clinical data from different sources to enable more meaningful clinical research and generation of actionable evidence?

A key challenge in enabling more meaningful clinical research and generation of actionable evidence is the lack of shared agreement in how to communicate clinical research and evidence data throughout all phases of research design, conduct, analysis, and reporting.

Key opportunities are established with the Evidence Based Medicine on FHIR (EBMonFHIR) Implementation Guide and the Scientific Evidence Code System (SEVCO). 

The HL7 FHIR standard (Health Level 7 International Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is already accepted and encouraged throughout the CMS/ASTP/ONC efforts noted in this HHS RFI as the standard for health data exchange.  Prior to 2018 there was no equivalent standard to support data exchange for scientific evidence.

In 2018, participants from communities of biomedical/healthcare research, systematic review development, clinical practice guideline development, and clinical decision support development collaborated to obtain approval of HL7 to extend FHIR to evidence-based medicine (EBM) knowledge assets, a project now called EBMonFHIR.

The community supporting the EBMonFHIR project evolved to become the Health Evidence Knowledge Accelerator (HEvKA), an open collaborative effort with 10 to 15 active working groups meeting weekly and bringing together at least 100 people from many disciplines and at least 18 countries. Participant details at https://fevir.net/HEvKA 

The EBMonFHIR project has extended FHIR to be used for science data exchange.  For example, a FHIR Evidence Resource provides a standard form to represent what the evidence is about (e.g. the effect on mortality comparing a treatment with a placebo in a specific population), the statistical findings for that evidence (e.g. a relative risk reduction of 5% with 95% confidence interval ranging from 10% risk reduction to 2% risk increase, or an absolute risk reduction of 10 fewer deaths per 1,000 people with 95% confidence interval ranging from 20 fewer deaths per 1,000 people to 4 more deaths per 1,000 people), and the certainty of the evidence (e.g. low certainty due to limitations in study design and wide confidence intervals). 

The Evidence Based Medicine on FHIR Implementation Guide (available at https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/ebm) covers many aspects of science data exchange.  It covers the broad scope of representation of scientific knowledge, including (1) citations to represent identification, location, classification, and attribution for knowledge artifacts; (2) components of research study design including study eligibility criteria (cohort definitions) and endpoint analysis plans; (3) research results including the statistic findings, definition of variables for which those findings apply, and the certainty of these findings; (4) assessments of research results; (5) aggregation and synthesis of research results; (6) judgments regarding evidence syntheses and contextual factors related to recommendations; (7) recommendations; and (8) compositions of combinations of these types of knowledge. The types of interoperability covered include syntactic (Resource StructureDefinitions) and semantic (value sets).

Strengths of the EBMonFHIR IG include development and maintenance within the ANSI-approved standards development processes with HL7, coordination with the HL7 FHIR standard used widely for health data, a broad community across the evidence ecosystem, and providing a base solution for interoperable data exchange across the EBM and patient care communities.

The Scientific Evidence Code System (SEVCO) (available at https://fevir.net/sevco) is a standard vocabulary for research study design, statistics, and risk of bias. SEVCO release 2.0 includes 468 terms with hierarchical relationships. The terms include definitions, alternative terms, and comments for application. The SEVCO ontology supports precise, unambiguous, machine-interpretable reporting of research. SEVCO was developed by an open, global, multidisciplinary, expert working group.

Strengths of SEVCO include openness (transparency and inclusiveness) for consensus development, comprehensiveness in scope of coverage, attention to prior works, diverse multidisciplinary participation, open access, and availability in both human-readable and machine-interpretable forms.

Leveraging this technical standard (EBMonFHIR) and standard vocabulary (SEVCO) can enable the clinical research and evidence ecosystem to experience interoperability like that found in financial, navigation, and entertainment ecosystems.

Enabling FHIR-Based Advance Directive Forms Through IP Clearance

Background:
The National Association for Home Care & Hospice (NAHC) stewards widely used advance directive forms across states. These forms often have IP restrictions limiting their digital, interoperable use. CMS can play a pivotal role in negotiating IP clearance and fostering adoption of standardized, FHIR-enabled advance directive forms to improve care coordination and patient empowerment.

Link to the forms that you can click on by state:

https://www.aarp.org/caregiving/financial-legal/free-printable-advance-directives/


Recommendation:
CMS should establish a multi-stakeholder initiative with NAHC, CaringInfo, state health agencies, EHR vendors, and standards organizations (HL7 International, ASTP/ONC, SNOMED International, Regenstrief Institute) to:
1.	Negotiate IP licensing agreements with NAHC and states to permit the use of advance directive forms in interoperable digital formats (FHIR resources).
2.	Support development and publication of FHIR Implementation Guides for advance directive forms aligned with state legal requirements.
3.	Incentivize adoption through Medicare/Medicaid quality programs and EHR  and API CEHRT certification criteria requiring support for FHIR-based advance directives.
4.	Encourage state alignment to harmonize legal and policy frameworks facilitating cross-state interoperability.
5.	Fund education and outreach for healthcare providers and IT implementers on the use of standardized digital advance directives.
Expected Outcome:
This approach will reduce IP barriers, enable interoperable advance directive data exchange nationwide, enhance patient-centered care, and improve clinical decision-making at transitions of care.
•	Digitize advance directives (move from PDFs/paper to structured digital forms)
•	FHIR-enable advance directives for nationwide interoperability
•	Resolve IP barriers with NAHC/CaringInfo/state forms
•	Support state-specific legal requirements in a standardized FHIR framework
•	Empower patients and families to view, update, and share directives digitally
•	Make directives available at point of care (ERs, hospitals, EMS, LTC, etc.)
•	Improve care coordination and decision-making across settings

Does CMS realize the HIE systems block patients from accessing them and so are designed to circumvent HIPAA? The exchanges share information about my health that I never see in the version of records I request. How can patients exercise their HIPAA rights to request corrections if they cannot even view the records?

Does CMS realize that providers can login and have instant access to patient records, but the subject of the record-the patient-is blocked from the records (aside from the minimal 'patient portal') must ask permission to view them, wait 30 days to view them, and often do not ever get the information requested?

TEFCA with Imaging 
TEFCA should prioritize the inclusion of imaging exchange use cases, leveraging existing IHE profiles such as XDS-I.b, MHD, and AIR. While imaging has historically been excluded from TEFCA’s initial document-focused design, national imaging interoperability is critical for AI workflows, diagnostics, and care coordination.
CMS and ASTP/ONC should partner with organizations like IHE, RSNA, and vendors with FHIR/DICOMweb experience to advance TEFCA-aligned imaging pilots. TEFCA must eventually support imaging for it to be a comprehensive national framework.
Imaging with FHIR 
CMS should promote the adoption of HL7 FHIR for radiology to improve the interoperability, accessibility, and computability of imaging data across care settings. Today, imaging reports are often exchanged in narrative form via CDA or as unstructured PDFs, which limits their usefulness in clinical decision support, care coordination, and patient access.
FHIR resources like ImagingStudy and DiagnosticReport, when integrated with DICOMweb, enable rich, structured, standards-based radiology data exchange. This is essential for emergency response, telehealth, value-based care, and post-acute care.
I recommend CMS encourage the use of FHIR-based APIs for radiology in CEHRT certification, promote the use of DICOM-FHIR mappings, and prioritize structured radiology data in USCDI expansion. Including radiology interoperability in CMS and ASTP/ONC’s regulatory frameworks will unlock substantial clinical and operational value.

openEHR with radiology
openEHR provides a rich modeling environment for structured radiology results and imaging-related clinical observations. CMS and ASTP/ONC should explore integration patterns where openEHR-based structured reports can feed into FHIR-based APIs or TEFCA networks, especially for longitudinal imaging follow-up in oncology, neurology, or population health use cases. While DICOM and FHIR handle transport, openEHR supports semantic persistence and querying of imaging context over time.

SNOMED CT

SNOMED CT is useful for imaging with the clinical concepts for the radiology findings, like the imaging observable entities, such as 

<<Imaging finding (finding): 365853002
<<Imaging interpretation (observable entity): 282290005
<<Imaging observable (observable entity): 399060005

To support high-value radiology use cases such as AI-driven decision support, precision medicine, and longitudinal imaging follow-up, CMS and ONC should promote consistent use of SNOMED CT for three distinct but interrelated components:
1.	Imaging Procedures – Representing what was done (e.g., 169069000 |CT of chest|, 
Computed tomography of chest (procedure): 169069000

Magnetic resonance imaging of brain with contrast (procedure): 16327691000119101


using SNOMED CT ensures standardization of imaging modalities, body regions, and intent (diagnostic, screening, follow-up).

2.	Observable Entities – Capturing structured measurements and characteristics such as size, attenuation, location, or number of findings 
Lump size (observable entity): 248529005
Number of lesions (observable entity): 246206008 
provides the computable backbone for AI, tumor tracking, and structured reporting.

3.	Findings and Impressions – Coding clinical conclusions derived from imaging, such as 
Solitary nodule of lung (finding): 427359005
enables semantic alignment with registries, downstream care, and analytics.
These three SNOMED CT hierarchies—used together—create a fully structured radiology record that can be expressed in FHIR DiagnosticReport and Observation resources, or modeled in openEHR using archetypes like imaging_exam_result.v1.
CMS should encourage certification requirements and TEFCA QHIN workflows that support this level of semantic structuring to enable image-enabled clinical decision-making, cohort identification, and longitudinal follow-up. This approach also aligns with emerging IHE profiles (e.g., AIR), openEHR adoption in the EU, and global convergence around FHIR and SNOMED CT for imaging interoperability.

Interoperability involving medical records and claims data is drastically reducing competition, decreasing patient choice, and reducing quality of care.

Medical providers do not compete. Patients can’t get a second opinion anywhere. And if the patient has been misdiagnosed or experienced a medical error at any point in time, providers will not accurately diagnose the patient, leaving the patient with no treatment and creating chronic illness. Each doctor copies the last incorrect note, test result, or diagnosis. This occurs even if the patient is unsafe, even if the diagnosis contradicts reality. It is intentional. It is the culture.

Patients should hold the records in a central repository and have the ability to choose what to share with which providers and when. There should be incentives for providers to want to do better instead of maintaining the status quo.
 
It must be recognized that doctors often create chronic illness. CMS better find a way to fix this and keep patients safe. It is only getting worse as interoperability increases.

Massive Bio, Inc. is an AI-driven oncology clinical trial and real-world data technology company committed to democratizing access to advanced cancer care and research. Through our SYNERGY-AI platform, we engage over 160,000 consented oncology patients across 17 countries and integrate clinical, genomic, and real-world data from over 3,400 sites and 100,000 physicians. Recognized by the White House Cancer Moonshot, our mission is to transform access to precision oncology through patient-centric, digitally enabled platforms.

We appreciate the opportunity to provide public comment on CMS’s Request for Information 2025-08701 regarding the Health Technology Ecosystem. We commend CMS, ASTP, and ONC for taking steps to empower patients, foster interoperability, and create a trusted, seamless digital health landscape for Medicare beneficiaries.

Our comments focus primarily on:

PC-1 through PC-12 (Patients and Caregivers)

PR-1 through PR-4 (Providers)

TD-1 through TD-10 (Technology Vendors and Data Providers)

II. Key Recommendations and Responses

PC-1 / PC-2 / PC-3 / PC-5 / PC-6 – AI-driven Navigation & Real-Time Trial Matching

Massive Bio’s Patient Connect app helps Medicare beneficiaries understand their condition, organize medical records, and match in real time to clinical trials based on genomic, imaging, and EHR data. This hybrid “click-and-mortar” system combines digital screening with concierge support, enabling participation from rural or underserved areas. Patients have reported easier decision-making and faster access to therapies. We recommend CMS promote such tools by creating a ""CMS Trusted App"" designation and integrating trial awareness into the Annual Wellness Visit.

PC-4 / PC-8 / PC-9 / PC-10 / PC-12 – Integrated Data, TEFCA, and Real-Time Use Cases

Structured access to full EHR data, especially pathology reports and genomics, remains elusive. By leveraging TEFCA and FHIR-based interoperability, Massive Bio aggregates records from multisite networks and identifies high-probability matches for trials. We support extending Blue Button 2.0 to include MA encounter data, genomics, social determinants, and lab results, and enabling patient-mediated FHIR access to HIEs.

PR-1 / PR-2 / PR-4 – Reducing Provider Burden with Smart Integration

Providers in our network benefit from AI tools that auto-extract eligibility from EHRs and reduce manual chart review. CMS should further support digital product integration into physician workflows through CPT codes for digital navigation and via funding implementation grants (especially in rural ACOs). Interoperability policies should mandate APIs that support both structured and unstructured data.

TD-1 / TD-2 / TD-3 / TD-4 / TD-9 / TD-10 – Unlocking Innovation for Developers

Developers require clearer access pathways to CMS data and APIs beyond claims (e.g., imaging reports, genomic annotations, social care data). CMS could establish a Developer Sandbox with synthetic data and credentialed digital identity frameworks (e.g., Login.gov + SMART on FHIR) to facilitate application development. We encourage support for OpenID Connect, and expansion of the ONC Certification Program to prioritize real-time patient-use APIs.

VB-1 / VB-3 / VB-5 / VB-11 – Aligning Digital Tools with Value-Based Oncology

Massive Bio supports inclusion of digital oncology tools into ACO models and the Enhancing Oncology Model (EOM). CMS could incentivize trial referrals, tele-consent, and AI-driven remote monitoring as measures of innovation and equity in care navigation. Pilot projects could link Medicare claims to real-time eligibility APIs to inform shared savings calculations.

III. Conclusion

We commend CMS and ONC for their leadership in advancing the patient-centric digital ecosystem. To unlock the full potential of health technology for Medicare beneficiaries, CMS should:

Prioritize use of certified AI-powered tools that enable decentralized clinical trial access.

Expand patient access to all EHR formats under TEFCA and Blue Button.

Invest in caregiver support features and multi-language accessibility.

Promote public-private partnerships that drive innovation, such as ACTR and trial-matching.

Massive Bio is eager to continue supporting these efforts. We are available for demonstration or pilot engagement opportunities with CMS and ONC.

Medical and data errors find their way into patient records in a multitude of way.  Human error, miscommunication, misdiagnosis, missed diagnosis, medical errors, the wrong patient's data in the wrong patient's records, AI hallucination, transcription errors (human, software, AI), medical fraud, and identity theft. Feeding all data into any AI or software system without a robust data validation and data integrity process will lead to massive amounts of medical errors including misdiagnoses, missed diagnoses, incorrect medication and treatment recommendations, patient harm, wasted time and medical resources, increased medical costs, the need for more medical care to correct the medical errors, patient harms up to and including patient death.

•  CMS should ensure quality measures include patient refusal exclusions to avoid penalizing providers unfairly.
•  Measures for breast cancer, colon cancer, A1C, and BP control often lack standardized refusal handling across programs (e.g., MIPS vs. Star Ratings).
•  Repeated outreach to patients who decline care creates inefficient care loops, staff burnout, and verbal escalation toward nurses and MAs.
•  Providers face pressure from health plans, CDOs, and HEDIS teams to repeatedly “nag” patients despite refusals without clinical benefit.
•  Technology vendors (TD) must support structured refusal documentation (e.g., SNOMED CT codes) to enable fair measure exclusions.
•  CMS should address health IT ecosystem misalignment — providers (PR) are penalized while patients (PC) can refuse and vendors (TD) may not support refusal capture.
•  Remote monitoring data (e.g., BP cuffs, CGMs) should be integrated and measured appropriately, with patient opt-outs excluded from penalties.
•  CMS must ensure that value-based care models (VB) reward actual provider effort, not just patient behavior.

We oppose all medical mandates to access society because people are not a monolith; we think independently and individually

When it comes to health technology, I believe in privacy rights for all patients as well as the rights of parents to advocate for their children. 

1. There is absolutely no need to force digital ID requirements for any human being to access healthcare in globally.  Who comes up with these rules for everyone to group think.  There must be choices and options always.  If the powers that be wants to do this, then go ahead and let others be free will thinkers as God intended it to be.

2. No one should be forced to provide any biometric data to access healthcare in America, ever. (Agree).

3. Under no circumstances should any wearable technology ever be mandated on any human for any healthcare purpose. Informed consent must always be the standard. (Agree).

4. Everyone should have ""the right to be forgotten,"" meaning if Artificial Intelligence or other technological tools are being used to gather data on a patient, it should be up to the individual if that data is stored or deleted. (Totally in agreement with Mr. Kane).

For context, here is a summary of my background as to how I come to my recommendations: 
• 30 years healthcare experience across multiple settings
• 20 years health technology implementation and adoption
• 20 years privacy & security compliance 
• 15 years in federal and state legislative and regulatory advocacy pertaining to health IT, interoperability, privacy, security, quality payment programs, public health, and Medicaid
• 5 years facilitating innovation through standards development, accreditation programs, and strategic partnerships

My comments are these:

No matter what policy and implementations come forth from the results of this RFI, adoption cannot be fully realized unless CMS and ASTP engage intimately with the impacted stakeholders. In my many years of experience I have witnessed consistently that policy makers and technology developers have created frameworks, tools, mechanisms, and models that may work perfectly at a macro or technical functionality level but are not being used, or used fully, by those giving, receiving, or paying for care. There are so many gaps in implementation and adoption whereby the end users do not know a technology exists, has had it insufficiently implemented, or does not have the adequate resources (financial, technically adept workforce, time, etc) to execute implementation and subsequent optimizations. Given that, I would like to offer the two following recommendations:


1. ""True"" real world testing. In other words, getting to the actual workflow and experience in every size, type, and geography of organization or user/stakeholder. For example, not once in any of my personal encounters for care, payment, or diagnostics have I ever fully experienced interoperability, access, digitization in a manner that I know to be possible given the work that I do. Such as when my PCP finds my test results from another health system via our state HIE (good!) but then prints it out to have staff scan back into the system (bad!) because they either do not have, or do not know how, to import into their EHR in a discrete manner that will populate key fields that will satisfy quality measures and decision support. I would like to see HHS develop a program to assess these issues more closely. This could look like a 'tracer' or 'secret shopper' type of approach to see how this really works in practice. By contrast, if an organization or vendor knows HHS is asking to see this, they will show you everything that is working the best or in theory, not what the staff or consumers are experiencing on a daily basis. 
2. Institute a technical assistance pathway that is more than guidance or implementation documents. It needs to be hands-on support with organizations. I recommend this vs. lump sums of incentive money because the organization who needs the most help may not know that the best use of those funds may be best spent on a consultant or a specific type of technical staff member. Also, giving incentive payments may or may not be sustainable into the future. Usually the latter. Knowing this, sometimes organizations are reticent to use it to upgrade technical environments because they won't be able to keep up the improvement due to future funds. For instance, I worked with a state public health department on where they were hesitant to apply for modernization funding because it would come in a large sum and couldn't sustain their infrastructure far into the future and they didn't believe the funds would continue. Which turned out to be a legitimate fear as public health funding has decreased. Guidance on how to implement and sustain any technical improvements will be essential to true adoption. 

Please do not hesitate to reach out to me as a resource. I am passionate about being part of the solution to improve outcomes through integration of information to patients & caregivers, providers, & payers.","Health Care Industry - PI015",,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2025-0050-0367/attachment_1.png,https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2025-0050-0367/attachment_1.pdf","pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

1. Technology Vendors
Create a two‑tier “Certified Developer Access Track.”
Tier 1 opens a structured, developer‑ready HPMS plan‑benefit dataset; Tier 2 grants read‑only MARx/BEQ eligibility checks (dual status, LIS, SEP, current enrollment).

Stand‑up a CMS‑hosted Standardized Enrollment API. Certified platforms could submit, track, and correct applications directly—eliminating today’s costly, proprietary middleware and extending AOR transparency.

Adopt a plan‑developer co‑review model for content compliance. Plans and certified vendors jointly attest to benefit‐display accuracy; CMS spot‑audits instead of reviewing every screen.

Require open standards (FHIR, SMART on FHIR, OAuth/OIDC) across all new CMS APIs. This ensures one integration path rather than multiple proprietary feeds.

Public RFP disclosure with security pre‑screening (e.g., HITRUST/SOC 2). Publishing all tech‑related RFPs and allowing only pre‑qualified vendors to bid broadens competition while limiting noise.

2. Data Providers
Expand and enrich priority CMS APIs.
• BEQ API – add Medicaid level detail, SEP flags, human‑readable error codes; drop “plan‑sponsor only” restriction.
• Provider Directory API – require near‑real‑time updates, new‑patient status, wait times, languages, accessibility, network tier, C‑SNP/D‑SNP filters.
• Patient Access API – include encounter histories, prior auths, benefit accumulators; support caregiver delegation and multi‑payer consent.
• Payer‑to‑Payer API – mandate a single schema for enrollment history, pre‑auth carry‑over, and provide shared sandboxes.
• Prior Authorization API – support batch queries, real‑time responses, standardized service codes, and publish turnaround benchmarks.

Blue Button 2.0 enhancements. Add MA encounter data, current coverage elections, OOP accumulators, LIS status, care‑team NPIs, and social‑risk indicators.

Streamline beneficiary credentialing. Issue Medicare.gov access codes at enrollment, enable Login.gov / ID.me federation, and publish SDKs for user‑friendly onboarding.

3. Networks (Exchange & Directory Infrastructure)
National, FHIR‑based provider‑directory standard. CMS should define the schema, require quarterly plan attestations, expose an open registry, and allow provider self‑attestation to reduce plan burden.

Promote TEFCA alignment while eliminating redundant pathways. Encourage QHIN participation for broad coverage but unify overlapping standards to a small core set (FHIR, OIDC, CDS‑Hooks).

Mandatory publication of FHIR endpoints and digital‑identity requirements. A nationwide directory combining endpoint URLs with trusted identity credentials would simplify routing and security for payers, providers, and consumer apps.

Support bulk‑FHIR and group‑based queries. Shared network infrastructure should favor scalable, population‑level access over point‑to‑point feeds, reducing provider burden for quality reporting and care coordination.

Maintain sustainability with CMS governance. CMS can ensure critical mass by tying compliance deadlines, certification pathways, and audit requirements to network participation.

These actions, taken together, lower entry barriers for innovators, guarantee richer real‑time data for decision support, and create a transparent, standards‑driven ecosystem that ultimately benefits beneficiaries, caregivers, and the broader Medicare market.

As a multi-state virtual behavioral health provider serving primarily Medicaid beneficiaries, we welcome CMS's efforts to improve technology access and interoperability for Medicare. We strongly encourage CMS to extend these initiatives to Medicaid, where the need for modernization is even more urgent due to severe variation across states and managed care organizations (MCOs). 
--

STANDARDIZATION ACROSS STATES

Medicaid is administratively fragmented, with widely differing standards for credentialing, eligibility checks, and data access. CMS should: 

1. Establish a federal interoperability baseline for Medicaid programs.
2. Require uniform implementation of patient access APIs and provider data exchange standards across all Medicaid MCOs.
--

CREDENTIALING DELAYS

Credentialing with State Medicaid and MCOs continues to be one of the most significant obstacles for new provider groups:

1. Credentialing timelines routinely range from 3 to 12 months, with no standardization or transparency.
2. Duplicate submission requirements across MCOs within the same state add inefficiency.
3. Occasionally, the absence of retroactive billing during these long timelines leads to lost revenue and, more importantly, severe delays to care delivery.
4. Some MCOs do not accept tele-health only providers, restricting access to underserved regions.

Recommendations: 
1. CMS should require MCOs to comply with credentialing SLAs (e.g. 30-45 days).
2. Create a federal provider enrollment and credentialing platform for Medicaid to streamline onboarding.
3. Support national licensure portability efforts to enable virtual providers to serve patients across multiple state lines without duplicative barriers.
--

ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION

In several states, running automated eligibility checks for Medicaid beneficiaries is difficult or unsupported. This results in:

1. Significant time spent on manual eligibility verification, often using legacy web portals with limited API support.
2. Delays in care and administrative bottlenecks, especially for organizations serving thousands of patients per month. 
3. Increased risk of denied claims due to coverage changes that aren't surfaced until after a session. 

Recommendations:
1. CMS should standardize real-time eligibility API protocols across all Medicaid MCOs.
2. Require all Medicaid plans to offer programmatic access to eligibility verification, including retroactive coverage and benefit details. 
--

Although this RFI is focused on Medicare, we urge CMS to extend these modernization efforts across Medicaid as well. Doing so would enable equitable technology-driven care, reduce wasteful administrative burden, and unlock significant access improvements for millions of low-income patients. Providers are ready to scale evidence-based care, but we need aligned infrastructure and federal leadership to do so effectively. 

We welcome the opportunity to collaborate with the appropriate bodies to design, develop, and roll out these changes, if appropriate.

The billing process seems unnecessarily complicated and expensive for small providers such as OT, PT, ST, since I need to hire a biller, pay for a clearing house (a clearing house charges extra to bill Medicare).  I am now starting to use PC-ACE, for billing for free directly to Medicare which seems fantastic although it has not been easy to use.  (set up, directions, support could be greatly improved please!).  I hope this direct billing to Medicare improves for small providers so many more small providers will not hesitate to provide services, increasing the number of providers to Medicare beneficiaries.  Speaking of support.  over the years I have found Noridian Medicare support staff out of North Dakota(?) to be extremely helpful and considerate (not time consuming, just efficient and respectful and knowledgeable).  Keep that up!  We need similar support for the PC-ACE process.  Please improve the PC-ACE program for billing Medicare!  

There are comments about using tech to track Medication.  But true health is about so much more.  We need a way to track the stories of people's experience so that providers can empathize, hear how health changes with treatments and services.  Tech can do so much more than monitoring the simple things to  monitor like meds,and blood pressure.  Occupational Therapy and the rehab professionals are about how well people LIVE, what they do, the quality of their life.  Cognition, Mobility, Being Pain Free, Engagement, Confidence, Satisfaction, Lack of Fear, Adaptability:  please add these factors into your tech processes.

The United States healthcare system has reached the absolute limit of what a compliance-driven, market-led approach to interoperability can achieve.

Response to RFI: Health Technology Ecosystem
CMS-0042-NC
Submitted by: Human Services Research Institute (HSRI)


Organization Background: Human Services Research Institute (HSRI) is a nonprofit organization with over 40 years of experience in person-centered care across the lifespan. We develop healthcare transparency websites, manage state all-payer claims databases, and conduct research to improve health outcomes for vulnerable populations. Our work includes extensive expertise in behavioral health systems, intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) services, and integrated care models for individuals who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. We have supported states, federal agencies, and healthcare organizations in developing data systems, quality measurement frameworks, and care coordination models that bridge medical, behavioral, and social services.
________________________________________
Executive Summary
While we appreciate CMS and ASTP/ONC's efforts to advance digital health technology for Medicare beneficiaries, we respectfully submit that the current RFI framework represents a significant missed opportunity. By focusing primarily on Medicare beneficiaries, this initiative overlooks the fundamental principle that health is a lifelong journey requiring seamless care coordination across all ages, payers, and care settings.

Our core recommendation: Expand the scope of health technology interoperability initiatives to encompass true lifespan interoperability that serves all individuals regardless of age, insurance status, or care setting. This approach will ultimately better serve Medicare beneficiaries by ensuring they enter the Medicare system with comprehensive, accessible health histories and can transition seamlessly between different care environments throughout their lives.

Conclusion: The future of health technology lies not in payer-specific solutions but in comprehensive, person-centered approaches that follow individuals throughout their lives. By expanding the current Medicare-focused framework to embrace lifespan interoperability, CMS and ASTP/ONC can create truly transformative digital health solutions that improve outcomes, reduce costs, and enhance the healthcare experience for all Americans. What's needed is the policy leadership to require open standards, cross-system integration, and genuine commitment to serving the public good.

HSRI stands ready to contribute our expertise in person-centered care, health data transparency, and state health information systems to support this expanded vision. We urge CMS and ASTP/ONC to consider how broadening the scope of this initiative will ultimately better serve Medicare beneficiaries by creating a more integrated, comprehensive, and equitable health technology ecosystem.

In particular, the digital divide, now recognized as a super social determinant of health, risks exacerbating health disparities for certain populations. To bridge the digital divide for system-wide impact in health care, it is critical to address the digital divide in consumers’ capacity to adopt and use patient portals in their ongoing care management.  

Certain populations, such as aging individuals, commonly encounter barriers as a result of limited digital skills and physical accessibility issues. Psychosocial factors can also be barriers to learning such as “tech anxiety,” or fear of “breaking” something using technology, or “tech hesitancy” due to the uncertainty about the value and benefit of digital interventions in their lives. Unfamiliarity with portal features (like secure messaging and appointment scheduling) can reduce adoption rates further.

The digital divide in health care underscores the importance of delivering interventions that provide digital health navigation and critical digital literacy training and supports at the community level. To promote digital inclusion and improve health outcomes, user-friendly, specialized and individualized training approaches with patient instructors can enable healthcare consumers to acquire the critical skills needed to log-on, schedule appointments, message providers, view test results, and refill prescriptions, potentially leading to fewer missed visits, better treatment adherence, and reduced health disparities.

San Francisco Tech Council (SFTC) believes tackling the digital divide requires broad-based, intentional collaboration, as well as integration of digital inclusion programming into community support systems. In 2023-24 SFTC led a collaborative development effort between community-based organizations, medical providers, and digital health practitioners of a web-based, interactive patient portal training platform that provides a simulated practice environment for consumers to acquire the digital skills they will need, practice key patient portal functions and build confidence in a safe environment and without compromising personal health data. Training is delivered in community settings (eg, community centers, libraries, affordable housing) by digital navigators.

SFTC piloted the intervention in 2024. Barriers to patient portal use among two-thirds of participants who identified as non-users of patient portals were: (i) not sure how to use it and (ii) never heard of it. The pilot identified several variables as key determinants of optimal patient portal adoption and usage: (i) comfort or level of competency with technology skills and (ii) whether participants had someone available to help with technology. Post-pilot surveys reported the training was effective in increasing patient portal use, both in terms of encouraging more people to use it and promoting more frequent use among existing users.

Zlenox welcomes CMS’s RFI CMS-0042-NC on interoperability. As creators of the Zlenox Healthcare Enterprise Resource Planner “ZHERP”—a cloud-native EHR/HRM/CRM for post-acute care—we offer policy perspectives to foster an open, collaborative ecosystem for both established vendors and emerging innovators.

Increasing competition in an EHR market dominated by a single company with over 75 percent market share is essential to ensuring that skilled-nursing facilities (SNFs) boost productivity through technological adoption. When one company controls the de facto system of record for SNFs, third-party innovators cannot introduce new solutions without full interoperability, covering both administrative and clinical data.

II. The Imperative for Competition

• Medicare Scale & Value: In FY 2022, Medicare Part A payments to SNFs reached $27.2 billion across 15,000+ facilities. Ensuring those funds drive value, rather than entrenching static systems, is vital for cost-effective, high-quality care.

• Network-Effect Barriers: Developers target large user bases; facilities hesitate to switch without a mature app ecosystem. This cycle can stall innovations like decision-support modules, staffing alerts, or readmission analytics unless structural measures lower barriers.

• Data-Portability Friction: USCDI ensures a baseline export, but full record migration still relies on custom, vendor-specific extracts that must be transformed and manually reconciled. Combined with staff retraining and change management, this friction deters facilities from adopting new systems.

III. HALO-Inspired Collaborative Framework

Canada Health Infoway’s HALO illustrates how to build inclusive interoperability:

• Central App Catalog: A vendor-neutral SMART on FHIR repository with streamlined certification.

• App Accelerator: Shared infrastructure enabling platforms—regardless of FHIR support—to host SMART apps seamlessly.

• In-UI Embedding: Deep-link and UI-extension specs that integrate third-party apps natively within the EMR interface.

• Layered Profiles & Security: US Core and SMART OAuth2 provide a baseline; adding post-acute extensions and enforcing full SMART conformance eliminates bespoke mapping. IV. Policy Recommendations

1. National App Repository Mandate: Require all certified EMRs to support a centralized, ONC-endorsed SMART on FHIR catalog with clear security and performance criteria, governed by a multi-stakeholder council.

2. Enhanced Data-Portability Standards: Expand Cures Act requirements to mandate full-scope exports (standard and custom elements, configuration data, audit logs) within defined timelines (e.g., 30 days) and quality thresholds (e.g., ≥ 99 percent completeness), backed by reference tooling.

3. SMART UI Embedding Extension: Adopt a “UI-Host” profile in SMART on FHIR for deep-link parameters and launch contexts; require EMRs to expose this endpoint natively or via a shared accelerator.

4. Non-Discrimination & Fair Access: Prohibit unreasonable fees, arbitrary delisting, or throttling of certified SMART apps; allow transparent, security-focused controls rather than closed-door approvals. 

5. Collaborative Pilot Programs: Fund joint demonstrations pairing incumbents and startups in SNFs to co-develop integrated solutions and evaluate outcomes—readmission rates, clinician efficiency, migration costs, and patient satisfaction.

V. Conclusion

By combining a HALO-inspired app ecosystem, strengthened data-portability mandates, and structured collaboration, CMS can create a balanced, competitive post-acute care marketplaceenabling vendors of all sizes, including Zlenox, to deliver better tools, lower costs, and improved patient outcomes. We look forward to partnering with CMS, providers, and peers to realize this vision.

Intellectual Property Issues with Assessment Scales 

One of the biggest issues with the data exchange of assessment scales is the intellectual property, meaning that every standards organization would need to get IP approval to share the questions and answers of an assessment scale.



SNOMED International wrote a document related to this entitled “Principles for managing Assessment Scales in SNOMED CT.”
As one can imagine, if an EHR vendor or healthcare application vendor obtains IP approval from every organization to do an assessment scale, that could be very expensive. 

One recommendation is that CMS could:
•	Negotiate blanket licenses for common tools (e.g., MoCA, Barthel Index, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Lawton IADL, COPD Assessment Test, Asthma Control Test, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Gilliam Autism Rating Scale, Autism Spectrum Quotient) across providers.
•	Require IP holders to publish digital, interoperable versions as a condition of endorsement.
•	Fund development of open-access alternatives to reduce dependency on restricted tools if licensing is prohibitive.
•	Include FHIR-compatible versions of assessment tools in standard rulemaking (e.g., QPP, MVPs).
•	Explore multi-stakeholder partnerships (tool owners, standards bodies, federal agencies) to create a licensed digital content clearinghouse.
•	Issue grants or contracts to buy rights for common tools, common assessment scales and facilitate inclusion in SNOMED CT and LOINC.
•	Promote use of these licensed digital assets in regulations, programs, and certification criteria.


Some of these assessment scales and questionnaires are prevalent in the common chronic illnesses such as assessment scales for:
•	Dementia
o	Mini Mental State Exam
o	Montreal Cognitive Assessment
o	Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
o	Functional Activities Questionnaire
•	Alzheimer’s
•	Asthma
o	Asthma Control Test
o	Asthma Control Questionnaire 
o	Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire 
•	Autism
o	Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule
o	Gilliam Autism Rating Scale 
o	Autism Diagnostic Interview- Revised

As a firm providing product advisory and software development to healthcare organizations, including providers, payors, tech-enabled services, and independent software vendors (ISVs), we bring perspective from building, implementing, and maintaining software used by our customers who serve millions of patients - many of whom are Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Our comments focus on expanding interoperability, improving standards adoption, and enabling scalable data exchange for modern healthcare use cases.


Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement (TEFCA) (PC-10, PR-6):
Newfire supports the continued adoption and advancement of TEFCA. We recommend that future regulations mandate the expansion of TEFCA (and require query responses by network participants) to use cases beyond treatment to enhance the usefulness of Qualified Health Information Networks (QHINs) for additional types of healthcare organizations, such as ISVs, with the consent of patients. This would require the implementation of advanced consent and identity management frameworks to make it easier for patients to consent to sharing their data with various parties and then easily manage that access, including restricting and revoking access at a later date. By empowering patients to manage consent dynamically, CMS and ASTP/ONC can promote trusted data sharing while preserving privacy and mitigating risks associated with indiscriminate data access.


Bulk FHIR (PR-5, PR-7, TD-9, TD-15):
Bulk FHIR has the potential to enable large-scale data liquidity between EHRs and other enterprise applications and third parties such as clinical research organizations (CROs). However, the current requirements for adoption of Bulk FHIR by EHR vendors do not go far enough to make it a reasonable option for many use cases, such as cohort analysis and population health outreach. Without regulatory incentives or requirements, EHR vendors lack strong market pressure to improve Bulk FHIR functionality.

Some of the current limitations include:
-EHR-imposed restrictions on the size of FHIR groups: Most EHR vendors explicitly or implicitly limit the number of patients for which a Bulk FHIR extract can be run; this limit may be as low as 100 patients. This inhibits the potential usefulness of Bulk FHIR beyond other data access options (e.g. individually calling many FHIR API endpoints for a given patient). 
-Lack of ability to create FHIR groups without EHR administrator involvement: For many use cases, the roster of patients that are in scope for a given run of Bulk FHIR may change frequently. Many EHR vendors currently require manual intervention from their support staff to create new groups, which slows down the process and may result in additional support costs for ISVs and healthcare organizations.
-Poor public documentation: Comprehensive, self-service documentation for developers would reduce implementation burden for all parties involved. 


Technical Standards and Certification (TD-7, TD-9(d)):
USCDI has significantly improved interoperability by requiring all certified EHRs to support a common dataset for API-based retrieval. The primary limitation that we see among our customers is the limited scope of EHR-supported USCDI data elements, which results in most interoperability use cases requiring the combination of USCDI FHIR endpoints with other integration methods such as HL7v2 and proprietary EHR APIs. USCDI could be further improved upon by continuing to expand the dataset over subsequent versions and incorporating these versions into future regulations that influence the adoption of FHIR APIs by EHR vendors and other parties, including for event-driven data flows.

Requiring the development and implementation of FHIR Subscription functionality among EHR vendors would be a large step toward fully migrating commonly-used interoperability mechanisms to modern infrastructure and reducing the implementation and maintenance burden of interoperability for a variety of affected parties including provider organizations and ISVs.

Dear Administrator Oz and CMS RFI Review Team,

Delfina Care Inc. (Delfina) welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Request for Information regarding the Health Technology Ecosystem (CMS-0041-NC). We are encouraged by your leadership in shaping a digital infrastructure that enables more effective and interoperable healthcare.
Executive Summary
Delfina’s mission is to transform pregnancy care by providing access to individualized insights and integrated systems that improve health outcomes. Delfina partners with managed Medicaid plans, provider organizations, and community-based healthcare practices to deliver our AI-powered maternal health technology platform. Our tech-enabled, closed-loop system of care helps healthcare providers identify patients who would benefit from early intervention, and then deploy evidence-based interventions and non-clinical support to the patient between clinical visits to help mitigate the risk for complications such as preeclampsia and preterm birth; leading drivers of maternal mortality and neonatal ICU (NICU) admissions. 
We fully support CMS's goals to promote interoperable, patient-centered technologies and urge CMS to explicitly prioritize maternal health use cases across its digital health modernization strategy. In the following comments, we offer recommendations based on our experience developing and deploying scalable digital tools that integrate into clinical workflows and support real-world impact in Medicaid and value-based care. 

Delfina Responses 
While not directly responding to any specific RFI question, we want to acknowledge that without a national reimbursement framework, any progress made in embracing the use of technology to serve patients remains incomplete. A unified billing policy (e.g., a dedicated CPT code for AI-enabled maternal health platforms) is crucial for fully realizing the potential of technology and supporting meaningful engagement from both providers and developers. Please find attached our responses to specific questions posed.

Conclusion and Request
Electronic Caregiver, Inc. (ECG) encourages CMS to consider Addison Care as a pilot-ready platform for real-world validation within Medicare and Medicaid populations. ECG's cloud-based platform-as-a-service (PaaS) software solution has been built on and validated by Amazon Web Services (AWS) as the most private, secure, and scalable solution to enable AI-driven care. Designed as an open solution, services and solutions connect to ECG's PaaS via APIs and webhooks to enable horizonal and vertical extensions of the solutions. Service extensions address issues such as social determinants of health (SDOH), social isolation and loneliness, ride share, medication management, 24/7 physician-on-demand, and falls risk identification, management, and response. Currently, ECG manages over 70,000 connected devices daily while leveraging algorithms and AI to receive, process, interpret, and deliver care insights to clinicals from over 500 million data invocations annually. ECG's robust platform is built to support over 100 million users. ECG's platform is directly integrated into the athenahealth athenaOne EHR and integrated through leading care management platforms into EPIC, Cerner, and other leading EHRs. 

ECG's leadership in the area of AI+Aging solutions is recognized via the National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarding ECG and UMass-Amherst a grant to accelerate productization of an innovative product for falls risk identification and prevention, at home. Leveraging computer vision, an AI-driven virtual avatar, AI, and algorithms - Addison Care delivers functional assessments, gait analysis, the Johns Hopkins Falls Risk Assessment to older adults at home, at any time, to proactively address increase risk of falls. This is but one example of how an AI-driven solution can provide on-edge intelligence and insights to complement clinicals to enhance decision making. 

We support a future where AI-led, consumer-centered tools are certified, reimbursed, and fully integrated into the national health technology ecosystem. We welcome further discussion and look forward to CMS’s continued leadership in shaping a more connected, patient-friendly system.

I sincerely applaud CMS for initiating this RFI regarding the health technology ecosystem. I submit these reflections to help guide CMS and ONC toward a future where digital tools are truly care-enabling.
1)	To truly advance quality and safety in healthcare, we must move beyond static, retrospective measures and instead incorporate the lived experiences of patients as active contributors to improvement. Current tools like HCAHPS, while valuable, offer a limited and often delayed view of care experiences, missing key dimensions such as emotional safety, real-time responsiveness, and other nuances of care that are necessary to really improve care. Patients are more than survey respondents - they are experts in how care feels and functions across settings. CMS should support infrastructure that enables continuous, bidirectional feedback loops - integrating patient stories, PROMs (Patient-Reported Outcome Measures), PREMs (Patient-Reported Experience Measures), and digital feedback channels into the core of quality measurement. Embedding patient voice will not only improve outcomes for all Americans, it will rebuild trust in care.

Policy recommendation:

•	Develop a mechanism to collect beneficiaries experiences and outcomes through multiple channels (online, phone/text, etc).  Such a mechanism is vital to understanding/addressing care gaps and identifying brights spots (and learning why they are bright spots).  Such a tool could inform initiatives across HHS.

2)	Patients deserve real control and understanding of their health data, as well as a prominent voice that shapes healthcare quality. Currently, patients often struggle to navigate multiple portals just to access labs or visit summaries. A truly person-centered ecosystem should provide access to the full spectrum of data that influences health, including prior authorization status, social needs, and benefits information. Expansion of Blue Button to include these elements could enable a new generation of apps that help people manage their care - not just when they’re sick, but every day. Furthermore, 
Policy recommendations:
•	Expand Blue Button application programming interfaces (APIs) to include Medicare Advantage encounter data, prior authorization status, and community referrals. 
•	Support Bulk FHIR export for patients switching providers or apps, ensuring portability.

3)	For providers, technology should reduce friction -not introduce more. Promising digital tools often cannot have the impact they should due to barriers in implementation specific to electronic health records. CMS could support better alignment by requiring modular, standards-based APIs, promoting ingestion of community and wearable data, and ensuring clinical utility is prioritized in certification criteria.
Policy recommendations:
•	Mandate EHRs support modular, plug-and-play APIs for external tools, including SMART-on-FHIR launch contexts
•	Require ingestion and export of patient-generated health data from wearables, home devices, and community sources via FHIR Device and Observation resources.
•	Include support for FHIR Document Reference and Optical Character Recognition of scanned legacy files to reduce paper-based silos.
•	Incentivize clinical decision support that integrate real-time data into provider workflows (e.g., maternal early warning systems, risk flags).

4)	Many brilliant startups wither due to opaque hospital integration costs or prohibitive certification requirements. CMS has an opportunity to change this. A national open marketplace for certified digital health tools - paired with technical assistance for early-stage developers - would be a meaningful step toward democratizing access to innovation. Additionally, monitoring and publishing common interoperability “pain points” would bring needed transparency to the developer experience and promote trust across the ecosystem.
Policy recommendations:
•	Create a CMS-led open marketplace of certified digital tools with transparency around integration capabilities and TEFCA compliance.
•	Establish a developer technical assistance program for early-stage or under-resourced vendors serving high-need populations.
•	Mandate vendor reporting of integration fees and timelines as a condition of certification.
•	Publicly track and publish patterns of interoperability blocking, similar to the HHS Transparency in Coverage rule’s approach.

As someone inspired by MAHA’s mission to elevate innovation that promotes health and transparency, I would be honored to support this work more directly. The future of care should be personal, proactive, and digitally fluent - and I would be delighted to contribute to shaping that future.

I lead the AgeTech Group for the Forbes Technology Council. I also serve as a Mentor to the National Institute of Health (NIH) Start-Up Challenge. Given the depth and breadth of my experience, coupled with the gravity of the chronic illness endemic and clinical provider shortage in the country, I strongly encourage the reviewers and Secretary to scale existing, proven AI-technology solutions and focus new innovation efforts into greenfield applications. Electronic Caregiver's Addison Care solution is a generative AI-powered conversational virtual caregiver which transforms the patient engagement and care adherence paradigm. 

This culturally-appropriate solution enables patients to select the race, gender, language, age, attire, holidays, and attire for their 24/7/365 caregiver - resulting in unmatched utilization and engagement. As a result, the significant health consequences of social isolation, loneliness, and depression are mitigated. Given the relationship developed, research has shown that the patients are more compliant and more honest in completing care surveys (Katz ADL Index, Johns Hopkins Falls Risk Assessment, SF12, etc.), measuring vitals, managing medications, and sharing status with human care coaches. As a result, clinical professionals receive timely, accurate, and actionable intelligence on the health and wellness of patients - improving health outcomes and optimizing resource utilization. 

The impact has been shown to be transformational: elimination of Type 2 diabetes, 47% reduction in readmissions for a rural hospital system, 70% expansion of bed capacity via hospital-at-home programs, and remote patient monitoring provided at 1/50th of the cost of hospital-based care. 

The ECG platform was specifically built as an open platform designed for integration with other healthcare technology companies, device companies, electronic health records (EHRs), pharmaceutical management platforms, revenue cycle management solutions, and service providers to address social determinants of health (SDoH). Moreover, built leveraging natural language processing, speech-to-text, and translation capabilities from AWS and Google, patients can engage with the platform in their native language. Simultaneous translation enables timely cross-language communications amongst all participants in the care circle, leading to better care and higher quality care. 

AI-driven care will play a central role to provide world-class care to all Americans. Solutions such as Addison Care - deployed at scale - will knock down barriers to care, expand access to care, and enable clinical professionals to have unforeseen insights into the health and wellness of patients in all settings. An open platform which brings together best-in-class capabilities into a unified and engaging interface for patients, clinicians, and non-clinical caregivers would be a fantastic complement to the capabilities and reach of the clinical EHRs which have developed over the past three decades. Now is the time for the community-based equivalent. I strongly encourage a deep review, analysis, and demo of ECG's existing products, services, integrations, and roadmap.","Health Care Professional/Association - Other Technician",,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2025-0050-0411/attachment_5.pptx,https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2025-0050-0411/attachment_5.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2025-0050-0411/attachment_4.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2025-0050-0411/attachment_2.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2025-0050-0411/attachment_6.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2025-0050-0411/attachment_3.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2025-0050-0411/attachment_1.pdf","pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

RE: Request for Information: Health Technology Ecosystem (CMS–0042–NC)

On behalf of WyDus, LLC, thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Request for Information titled Health Technology Ecosystem issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the Assistant Secretary for Technology Policy (ASTP), and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC).

WyDus, LLC is a consulting firm supporting digital health, diagnostic, and medtech innovators navigating reimbursement and market access in the U.S. healthcare system. These comments also reflect my personal perspective as a cancer survivor who has directly experienced the gaps in data access and care coordination highlighted by this RFI.

Summary of Recommendations

Improve Access to Second Opinions in Cancer Care
Launch a CMS demonstration program to support the development of a unified digital platform that enables patients to easily obtain second opinions. To encourage provider participation, the program should include reimbursement for digital pathology services and multidisciplinary tumor board reviews. The demonstration should assess the impact on diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, rural access, and patient outcomes.

Increase Reimbursement Predictability for Digital Health Tools
•	Establish an NTAP-equivalent program under the OPPS to support digital tools not currently eligible for TPT or new technology APCs.
•	Create a structured and timely payment pathway for new digital health services delivered in physician office settings.
•	Extend the NTAP period for digital health technologies to allow sufficient time for evidence development and support broader market adoption.

As an independent health advocate, I assist families in navigating the healthcare system and ensuring their health needs are met wherever they go (school, work, home, community, etc.). Quite often the first step with a new client involves gathering medical records and creating a workable medical history. This can take weeks to months depending on the health provider/health system the patient utilizes. 

While most providers have electronic records, those electronic records do not always come with easy access for the patient or their caregiver. Many outpatient health providers do not connect their electronic records systems to larger hospital systems, forcing patients and caregivers to request information from multiple sources. Even more importantly, these records are incomplete, often not including lab results, surgical reports, or other detailed testing/treatment. Depending on the health provider/system and how their electronic records system is setup, the patient and caregiver might only have access to partial records, forcing them to request paper records in writing, incurring costs, and waiting for those to be mailed and received. Considering specialized services like labs and radiology centers, these results are often not electronically available to a patient at all.

There are few health-related applications that allow a patient or caregiver to connect their medical record portals, curate notes/history, or share that information with others. Primary Record is the best application our agency has used and highly recommends it to each client. However, their platform is limited by the health providers/systems regulations and how they share patient records. Because each state also has different guidelines, patients who see providers across state lines, or who move, face significant difficulties in connecting past medical history to current and sharing that information with new providers.

There is also a significant gap in regulations for protected classes of patients, such as minors age 12-17. Their access to electronic records is limited and largely dependent on health provider/system rules (or lack thereof). In many instances, parents/caregivers are cut off from having electronic access to records, but there is no mechanism to allow the minor patients electronic access. Families are forced to request records in person, along with the minor patient. Thus when a minor patient becomes a legal adult, there are no electronic records or access to pass along from the parent/caregiver to patient. The patient must start their medical record keeping at ground zero.

A single point of access for patients and caregivers is essential as the healthcare system becomes increasingly challenging to navigate. As we live in times where technology can be helpful or hindering, healthcare as a system must make great strides to ensure every patient and caregiver can access their full medical records electronically, with ease.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Dear Administrator Oz,

On behalf of ATA Action, we are pleased to offer the below comments in response to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (“CMS” or the “Agency”) request for information with the goal of removing unnecessary barriers to digital health access and promoting health care innovation.

ATA Action, the American Telemedicine Association’s affiliated trade association, is focused on ensuring all individuals have permanent access to digital health products and services across the care continuum. ATA Action supports the enactment of state and federal digital health coverage and appropriate payment policies to secure digital health access for all Americans, including those in rural and underserved communities. ATA Action recognizes that digital health products and services have the potential to truly transform the health care delivery system – by improving patient outcomes, enhancing safety and effectiveness of care, addressing health disparities, and reducing costs – if only allowed to flourish. 

We are excited to share with you that ATA Action acquired the Digital Therapeutics Alliance (DTA) on March 31, 2025. The DTA was the leading international nonprofit trade organization focused on expanding access to digital therapeutics. Through this acquisition, ATA Action expanded its advocacy efforts to support digital health tools such as digital therapeutics, digital diagnostics, remote monitoring devices, and artificial intelligence by forming the Advancing Digital Health Coalition.

As a preliminary matter, we recognize the importance of the Agency’s deregulation efforts and encourage the removal of unnecessary digital health barriers while prioritizing regulations and guidance that encourage innovation.  We also thank the Agency for its ongoing efforts to increase beneficiary access to effective digital capabilities.  As further discussed below, we believe that a combination of deregulation and targeted guidance is necessary to promote health care innovation and digital health adoption.

In the attached file, Claritev is providing direct responses to several questions posed in this RFI and is also offering our perspective on multiple overarching themes and considerations that, if applied across CMS, can:  
•	Enhance the existing ecosystem to optimize the patient healthcare journey in conjunction with stakeholders, patients and caregivers 
•	Empower beneficiaries with better access to tools, personalized care navigation and information about treatments and cost so that beneficiaries can make informed, value-driven care decisions  
•	Reduce systemic barriers to care by expanding access in underserved populations and closing provider gaps in rural areas  
•	Utilize proven and emerging AI-based solutions to improve patient and caregiver experiences by leveraging data across multiple platforms to build a patient-centric experience 
•	Incentivize providers to optimize care with real-time, accurate and actionable data 
•	Aggressively modernize tools to quickly identify and mitigate fraud, waste and abuse through AI. 
We look forward to further discussions on all of Claritev’s recommendations and perspectives.

In addition, clinicians are tasked with working in fast-paced environments while navigating outdated systems.

Today, various systems that clinicians use are often disconnected. These include electronic health records, laboratory and imaging systems, pharmacy and medication systems, admission, billing, and patient discharge platforms.

When providers are focused on screens instead of patients, the risk of error rises, leading to missed information, medication mistakes, and unnecessary or repeated tests. This leads to slower care, lower satisfaction, and compromised patient trust.

To improve outcomes, healthcare leaders must evolve past outdated systems and opt for solutions that allow for open interoperability. Interoperability refers to the seamless exchange and use of health data within hospital and healthcare systems, applications, and devices.

Weak points in medication management systems compromise patient safety. It is critical that clinicians have access to the right information at the right time to create proper treatment plans and deliver the highest level of care. Intelligent medication management software that connects and contextualizes information from different systems is a critical at the point of care. 

A common problem that we hear from pharmacists is that they don’t have a single source of truth across systems. When this happens, they ask themselves, “Which information can I trust? The data that lives in the EHR, or the different data that lives within the medication administration record?” And sometimes, neither of those coincide with the information in the billing system, causing provider and patient frustration. 

The goal of interoperability is to seamlessly allow the data living throughout these siloed systems to unite, reducing administrative burden, and creating smoother workflows. As a result, patients can rest assured that they are receiving quality care they deserve, being billed correctly for services, and that the information they receive prior, during, and after care can be verified quickly.

Interoperability isn’t just a technology challenge for clinicians—it’s a regulatory and public health imperative. 

On a broader scale, interoperability is a current requirement in our healthcare supply chain through the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA). While it is critical for pharmacists and clinicians to have systems in place that provide data integrity at the point of care, DSCSA mandates additional visibility. Under these enhanced regulations, drug manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, and dispensers must securely and electronically exchange transaction information at the unit level. These standards aim to keep our healthcare supply chain safe by preventing illegitimate prescription drugs from entering the market and being administered to patients.

Our mission at Intelliguard is to create a world where an intelligent information ecosystem empowers healthcare providers to focus on patient-centered care. We partner with hospitals across the nation to transform physical activity into actionable data. The once disconnected data becomes structured, searchable, and available in real-time. This is made possible with Mira Intelligence, a comprehensive intelligent dashboard that exists within our AI-powered Mira Ecosystem. Additionally, Mira Intelligence provides cross-departmental alignment by bridging communication gaps in medication workflows with tailored dashboards for pharmacy directors, supply chain managers, compliance officers, clinical staff, and C-suite executives.

Technological advancements are driving better outcomes and healthier lives for patients. The industry is shifting beyond the outdated “one size fits all” mindset when it comes to treating patients. When clinicians have what they need at their fingertips, they can create customized treatment plans that take genetic makeup, lifestyle, and environmental factors into consideration.

An open, interoperable system isn’t the solution in itself; it is the result of adopting an intelligent, AI-powered medication management solution that transforms fragmented data into actionable insights. Medication management systems that enable interoperability, like the Mira Ecosystem, create safer environments for patients and empower providers by improving clinical processes, capabilities, and most importantly—patient care.

CMS has an opportunity to accelerate the adoption of interoperable digital healthcare infrastructure. Based on industry regulations and transformation that is underway, we urge CMS to incentivize the adoption of interoperable solutions and intelligent medication management systems across healthcare settings to alleviate provider burnout and staffing shortages, reduce administrative burden, enhance efficiency, and improve patient outcomes.","Health Care Industry - PI015",,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/CMS-2025-0050-0455/attachment_1.pdf","pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Over the past decade I have helped nearly 70 health plans stand up CMS-mandated FHIR APIs, connected to 1000s of provider systems, and now deliver AI-driven analytics on 140 million patient records. That experience gives me a unique lens into the HIT regulations, standards, technology across the government, patients, clinicians, and payers.

Despite progress with Patient Access APIs, adoption remains low due to limited patient incentives. While health plans and providers are motivated to use this data to improve outcomes and reduce costs, two key issues prevent API standards from replacing traditional connectivity methods to improve outcomes: 

1. The full patient record is not sent via FHIR
2. Ease of access to data is still blocked by gatekeepers at EHRs and other platforms

1) The record that travels through FHIR is incomplete. USCDI and proposed Prior Auth standards like Da Vinci are insufficient to stand in for direct EHR access, FAX transmissions, and PDF exports. They cannot power prior-authorization automation, HEDIS gap closure, or risk-adjustment analytics. Much of the evidence behind those workflows—physician narratives, imaging summaries, operative reports—remains locked in PDFs or images. Worse, real-world implementations vary so widely that the same data element appear in different resources or extensions.

2) Equally damaging is the friction in turning on data access. A hospital that wishes to connect a third-party population level app still faces months of back-and-forth between the EHR and the vendor before credentials are issued. For example we have first hand experience with multiple leading EHRs that had health IT companies on ice for up to 9 months before granting access to the EHR's FHIR apis even after the health systems wanted to provide access.

Furthermore, many of these standards and rules were envisioned nearly a decade ago, well before we imagined the generative AI tech that is now commoditized. We now have an opportunity to re-think the standards and regs with an AI forward mindset that positions healthcare IT for 5 years out when many of these regulations will be in full play. 


PROPOSAL 1: MOVE THE ENTIRE RECORD, NOT JUST THE DISCRETE SLICE

AI is now adept at processing unstructured data. Instead of creating administrative burden by structuring data into specific FHIR resources, we can send complete unstructured data through FHIR APIs via DocumentReference and Binary resources. For example, for prior auth requests, payers should receive full PDFs showing therapy history and imaging. AI Vision-Language models can now efficiently process these documents - from checking for required signatures to analyzing complex clinical criteria. Traditional approaches like CQL for quality measures or prior auth decision trees are creating unnecessary complexity when LLMs can handle these tasks more accessibly and at lower cost. Questions requiring nuanced clinical understanding (like ""Could the beneficiary not be fit with a prefabricated AFO?"") are better suited for AI analysis of complete records rather than structured queries. At GenHealth, we've proven this approach works - processing thousands of prior auths daily using AI with 95% accuracy and 75% faster processing times, already meeting 2026 turnaround requirements. 

Ultimately supporting these use cases on the interoperability and authorization rails already established with FHIR will lead to better patient outcomes at lower costs.


PROPOSAL 2: MAKE SMART ON FHIR TRULY SELF-SERVICE

Technical capability is meaningless if turning it on stays painful. I urge CMS and ONC to mandate that any certified health-IT platform allow an authorized administrator—at a provider or payer—to enable a third-party app for both SMART on FHIR ""Launch"" context and Bulk Data in ten clicks or fewer. A typical flow should look like the developer consoles used by Google or Stripe:

1. Enter app name and redirect URI.
2. Choose environment (test or production).
3. Tick required scopes—e.g.,  patient, bulk, launch.
4. Confirm terms, pick patient population, and click ""Generate keys.""

The portal returns client ID and secret instantly, with no vendor ticket and no new servers or IT implementation required by the covered entity's IT team. Users of the data can leverage AI and are motivated enough to make the returned API data useful. 


THE UPSIDE

Adopting these two changes creates a win-win-win dynamic: patients gain faster approvals and better care insights through AI analysis, providers and payers reduce administrative burden to focus on clinical work, and government achieves simpler oversight with improved compliance rates and faster timelines.

I appreciate HHS leadership to date and recommend the agency focus rules on data completeness and time to access - two levers that can help make interoperability truly a problem of the past.

I am an individual working for a payer but commenting as an individual and not on behalf of my organization.

PA-1: For TEFCA, the common agreement can change over time and requires that whatever it specifies must be done. This does not allow any participant to join for some interactions but not others. A participant also does not appear to have any input into future changes.

PA-2: Name a standard API along with having that API be fairly strictly defined. As the currently recommended APIs have a lot of flexibility and room for interpretation or different way to populate it especially for the same Resource in different Implementation Guides, it does not make for a standard implementation. It is very likely that we would have to construct a mapping for each different provider platform we connect to (not for each provider but to the EMR platform they use). This is unlike X12 or NCPDP transactions where we generally have one mapping and there are very little room for interpretation.

PA-3: Do not understand this enough to say that we would be able to use it. A question would be how to ensure that a digital identity is associated with the correct member we know. For example if we have 3 different John Browns, if a John Brown approaches us with a CLEAR login how do we  know to associate it correctly. Also if digital identities like this are used across multiple platforms and logins, are we not breaking with a cardinal rule on reuse of login/password - having all eggs in one basket - which could cause issues if that one login is hacked?

PA-4: It might make it easier to find the endpoint for any provider as long as the information is current and clearly delineates for which interactions each endpoint should be used if a provider has more than one endpoint. It will not make the establishment of the connection or getting credentials any easier, just the discovery of the endpoint alone.

PA-5a: I am not very interested in receiving bulk data from providers as this is a risk to us since the more data we as a payer receive then the more we data we are responsible for storing and delivering via the APIs.

PA-5b: None known at this time to make this any easier or less burdensome.

PA-7: Not sure that CMS can encourage payers to do this. Only if a provider were causing potential costs to us as a payer due to missing some regulatory or legal deadline would we consider doing this. Otherwise we would not want to risk alienating our providers for whom our relationship and keeping them in our network is very important.

As we look to the future, it is only through collaboration, courage, and conviction that we are able to forge decisive solutions resulting in a better tomorrow for all Americans. It is abundantly refreshing to see that CMS is seeking poignant, directed feedback from Patients, Payers, and Vendors alike, as this most assuredly will provide the most cohesive “big-picture” possible.

Quadratic Digital believes that CMS is uniquely positioned to effectuate very meaningful outcomes, not only for patients, but for all stakeholders in American healthcare infrastructure, through the implementation of meticulously crafted solutions leveraging a wide range of novel technologies. As America’s guiding health agency, CMS has a long history of safeguarding and enabling the American people to have improved access to valuable healthcare and coverage, dating back to its origination as the Healthcare Financing Administration (HCFA). The advent of Value-Based care models and Alternative Payment models speaks volumes to the inextricable coupling of healthcare’s delivery and financial implications.

Quadratic Digital strongly believes that critical aspects for a comprehensive application of technology resulting in better outcomes for patients and attainable, affordable health coverage include improved interoperability between stakeholders, meticulous use of cloud computing capabilities, and targeted use of interpretive analytics leveraging machine learning. We have attached our responses to your most critical inquiries.

As trusted technology partners to CMS, and foremost, as Americans, the team at Quadratic Digital recognizes a civic duty to aid in accomplishing these goals for our fellow Americans and want to thank CMS for the diligent dedication to this mission. As you well know, America’s Health Ecosystem is vastly complex, with a wide array of stakeholders and operations in play; each with a crucial role to health outcomes for the American people. Together, in unity, I am confident that these outcomes can be improved to fortify the American Health System through data-driven decisions and observation of outcomes. I hope you find our insights to be beneficial as the agency plans its roadmap to success.

What changes would you suggest to address those limitations? To what degree do you expect these limitations to hinder participation in TEFCA?
•	CMS should require payer access to QHIN via required API to access and exchange provider EHR data

PA-2) How can CMS encourage payers to accelerate use of APIs for patients
•	CMS should focus on more promotion of patient access API in CMS Medicare educational and marketing materials

PA-3) Can CMS encourage plans to accept digital identity credentials, such as: CLEAR (airports), ID.me, Login.gov?
•	Plans having to use external authentication credentials complicates process.
•	The main issue is lack of a common enrollee identifier. Even if some systems login credential could be used, apps and plan need a common identifier to relate individual logging in with enrollee in plan system.

PA-4) Value of national provider directory of FHIR endpoints
•	National provider endpoint directory is very useful for plans to use implementing 2027 Prior Auth and Provider Access API mandate, and reduce threat from exchanging data with fraudulent actors

PA-5) Ways the plans can help simplify clinical quality data responsibilities of providers
a. How interested are plans and providers in EHR technology to enable bulk extraction of clinical quality from EHRs to payers for them to do calculations? 
•	Requiring an HL7 standard format, validated by NCQA, that includes bulk data extraction of quality data to plans from EHRs through national data aggregators would simplify data exchanges for both parties and alleviate proprietary plan format variations that providers otherwise encounter

b. In what ways can the interoperability and quality reporting responsibilities of providers to CMS and other payers be consolidated so investments can be dually purposed?  Technologies that support both informed clinical care and reporting?
•	Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (CCDA) is a standard for health data exchange, which a patient health encounter can be represented by a single electronic document. Adoption and dual required use of this standard format for both clinical quality reporting and clinical record keeping by providers and plans would simplify data sharing and decrease migration to meet varied proprietary formats.  

TD-1) Steps CMS can take to stimulate developer interest to build digital health products for Medicare enrollees
d.	What APIs should CMS & ASTP/ONC consider to unleash innovation to support patients & providers.
•	Require QHINs to allow payer access for data exchange via APIs between providers and plans

List of benefits:
1.	Semantic Alignment Across Agencies Without Schema Lock-in
•	Formal ontologies enable CMS, SSA, VA, and others to define domain-specific concepts independently while aligning on shared upper-level concepts (e.g., Person, Benefit, Encounter).
•	This supports semantic interoperability despite differing database schemas—key for TEFCA and whole-of-government data integration.
2.	Leverages NLM’s Trusted Expertise in Health Data Semantics
•	NLM’s stewardship of SNOMED CT, RxNorm, LOINC, and UMLS positions it well to coordinate federal formal ontology development.
•	A centralized branch (e.g., Health Data Standards Branch) could manage publishing, harmonization, version control, and API services.
3.	Supports Responsible AI and Large Language Model (LLM) Adoption
•	Ontologies provide AI systems with a ground-truth semantic layer that anchors predictions and conversational responses in well-defined concepts.
•	This enhances explainability, traceability, and trust, especially for CMS’s beneficiary-facing AI tools and decision support.
4.	Enables Smarter Interoperability in TEFCA and FHIR Exchange
•	Ontologies can support granular consent management (e.g., mental health, substance use disorder), data segmentation, and context-driven routing decisions.
•	FHIR natively supports integration with ontologies through CodeSystem, ValueSet, and StructureDefinition resources.
5.	Improves Program Evaluation and Policy Simulation
•	CMS can model value-based care, ACO attribution, social risk factors, and eligibility criteria using ontologies, enabling:
o	Policy simulation
o	AI-powered quality forecasting
o	Alignment of plain-language notices via natural language processing
6.	Enables Downstream Graph-Based Reasoning (Optional Future Phase)
•	After establishing agency ontologies, CMS can adopt graph databases and semantic reasoners (e.g., Neo4j, Stardog, SPARQL engines) for real-time inference.

Azuba Corporation respectfully submits this public comment in response to CMS-0042-NC, offering a production-ready platform that delivers multilingual communications, FHIR-driven interoperability, and real-time access to longitudinal clinical records. We support CMS’s bold vision to eliminate legacy burdens, expand digital access, and empower beneficiaries with co-equal participation in healthcare delivery and decision-making.

Azuba’s Health Communication Platform builds upon our enterprise-grade CCM solution, in use since 1986. It supports over 220 APIs and connects to 500+ EHRs, enabling real-time, standards-based access to clinical data for more than 100M CMS-covered lives and 260M+ individuals overall—including members across UnitedHealthcare, Elevance, and HCSC. Our workflows are multilingual (86 languages), compliant, and scalable, supporting tens of thousands of concurrent use cases and billions of transactions per year.

We propose the following CMS RFI-aligned recommendations:

PC-2, PC-9: Expand Blue Button 2.0 to support real-time FHIR access to clinical records, claims, ADT feeds, device data, and language metadata. Include endpoints for structured problem lists, immunizations, genomics, care plans, and prescription fills.

PC-14: Incentivize federated digital identity adoption via ID.me, Login.gov, etc., and support credential-based intake workflows. CMS should fund MA plan adoption and launch a revocable identity-linked app authorization portal.

TD-5: Create a CMS-hosted FHIR endpoint directory indexed by NPI with metadata: endpoint URL, supported FHIR version, TEFCA/QHIN participation, credentialing level (IAL2/AAL2), and access type (patient/provider/payer).

TD-8: Redefine certification to emphasize API maturity, longitudinal data completeness, and workflows for gap closure, ADT alerting, language capture, and SDOH tagging.

PR-8: Support FHIR bulk data export from EHRs for payer and APM performance reporting. Azuba processes bulk exports with deduplication, gap closure metrics, and submission-ready formats for HEDIS, MIPS, and Stars.

VB-3: Provide HIT infrastructure to APMs with configurable alerts, smart templates, attribution views, and member-driven engagement—extending support to caregivers and underserved communities.

Additionally, Azuba urges CMS to pilot a new model in which claims submission is replaced with real-time clinical FHIR APIs, enabling point-of-care adjudication validated against CMS coverage criteria. Our infrastructure supports this model today.

To demonstrate our alignment and readiness, Azuba has prepared seven (7) live use cases mapped to CMS RFI codes. These scenarios reflect real workflows in production and can be demonstrated virtually or in person:

Use Case 1: Care Manager Jane & Patient Irene
Payer/Provider Portal: One-click record retrieval across 500+ EHR systems touching 90%+ U.S. patients.
RFI Codes: PC-2, PC-10, VB-3

Use Case 2: Care Manager Jane & Patient Megan
ER Alerts: Real-time ADT-based notification with immediate record access.
RFI Codes: PC-9, VB-3, TD-8

Use Case 3: Claims Manager Eric & Patient Jerry
Direct Clinical Data for Adjudication: External record retrieval reduces claims cycle time.
RFI Codes: PR-8, TD-5, TD-8

Use Case 4: Member Megan & Daughter Carly
Smartphone Access: Credential-secured, caregiver-enabled data control.
RFI Codes: PC-1, PC-14, VB-3

Use Case 5: Care Manager Jane & Patient Irene (Mobile)
Emergency Mobile Access: Remote access to longitudinal records on-demand.
RFI Codes: PC-2, PC-10, VB-3

Use Case 6: Support Agent Dave & Patient John
24/7 Hotline Access: Agent portal delivers real-time access during after-hours needs.
RFI Codes: PC-10, VB-3, PR-8

Use Case 7: Support Agent Dave & Patient Megan
Workflow Automation: Optimized response time and service coordination.
RFI Codes: PC-1, TD-8, VB-3

Azuba's proven platform and readiness to execute place us in a strong position to partner with CMS on pilots that reduce administrative burden, eliminate fraud vectors, improve equity, and empower individuals.

Since 2010, Azuba executives have contributed to national health IT strategy via Blue Button, the Sequoia Project, Da Vinci, and the CARIN Alliance. We are deeply aligned with TEFCA and support CMS’s “good–better–best” glide path toward API-first, digitally verified, real-time data exchange. We invite CMS to leverage our deployed infrastructure in advancing national interoperability and health equity.

We welcome the opportunity to demonstrate these workflows to CMS.

- Equips health care providers with better information about their patients to improve outcomes &‬ reduce burden on doctors‬
- Ensures every diagnosis has supporting evidence so that we know it is accurate, helping to‬ eliminate fraud & waste‬
- Catches diseases early to foster more preventative care instead of the current sick-care paradigm‬. This can be achieved by incentivizing health systems to adopt AI technologies that review 100% of‬‭ patient data and surface evidence-backed diagnoses. CMS should prioritize technology that fits‬ seamlessly into the provider workflow. Creating CPT codes or AI pathways for NTAP would support‬ these efforts
