      "oneLineSummary": "A geriatric nurse and Medicare reimbursement coordinator argues that forcing seniors to enroll in Medicare at 65 when they are still working is burdensome and wasteful, advocating for enrollment only upon retirement.",
      "commenterProfile": "- **Name/Organization:** ann cook\n- **Type:** Individual\n- **Role/Expertise:** Lifelong geriatric nurse and MDS (Minimum Data Set) coordinator for Medicare reimbursement.\n- **Geographic Scope:** Local/State (MA)\n- **Stake in Issue:** Both personal and professional. She is personally navigating the Medicare sign-up process at age 65 while still employed with private insurance. Professionally, she has decades of experience helping patients and families navigate the Medicare system and fighting insurance denials.",
      "corePosition": "We should not have to sign up for Medicare A and B at age 65 or face a lifelong penalty, especially when we are still working and have private insurance we don't want to leave. The system is frustratingly complex and should be simplified to allow us to enroll only when we are ready to retire and actually need the coverage. This mandatory enrollment is an unnecessary burden on seniors and an overload on the Medicare system itself.",
      "keyRecommendations": "- **Change Enrollment Timing:** Eliminate the requirement to sign up for Medicare A and B at age 65. Allow individuals to enroll when they retire and are ready to use the benefits, without facing a lifelong penalty for \"late\" enrollment.\n- **Simplify the System:** Redesign the Medicare system to be fundamentally simpler and more intuitive for an aging population.\n  - Model it on easy-to-use technology like the \"Jitterbug phone,\" not the complex \"iPhone.\"\n- **Improve Education and Communication:** Make information accessible and easy to comprehend for users with declining concentration and cognitive abilities.\n  - Use visual aids like picture icons.\n  - Offer educational webinars about beneficiary rights as an alternative to the dense, multi-hundred-page Medicare manual and the confusing annual handbook.\n- **Regulate Medicare Advantage Plans:** Address the predatory practices of Medicare Advantage plans that deny entitled care to vulnerable seniors.",
      "mainConcerns": "- **Burdensome Mandatory Enrollment:** Forcing working seniors with private insurance to enroll at 65 is inefficient and creates unnecessary administrative work.\n  - The commenter had to enroll in Part A as a secondary insurance and then actively cancel Part B to avoid paying for unneeded coverage.\n  - This adds \"unnecessary garbage\" to the system and contributes to it being overloaded.\n- **Punitive Late Enrollment Penalties:** The lifelong monthly fine for late enrollment is financially devastating for seniors on fixed incomes.\n  - The penalty can be over $100 per month, forcing seniors to choose between paying it and affording essentials like groceries, medication, or heat.\n- **System Complexity:** The current system is too complicated and frustrating for seniors, whose ability to concentrate and comprehend complex information may be declining.\n  - This leads to widespread misunderstanding of benefits, as evidenced by confusion over the annual Medicare handbook.\n- **Predatory Medicare Advantage (MA) Plans:** MA plans are not working as intended and actively harm seniors.\n  - They deny care that traditional Medicare would cover.\n  - They prey on vulnerable, isolated, and cognitively impaired seniors by misrepresenting their benefits.\n  - **Example:** An MA plan denied skilled care and physical therapy for a woman with dementia after she fell and broke her hip, delaying necessary care until an appeal was won.\n- **High Costs Forcing Dangerous Trade-offs:** The high cost of medication forces seniors into \"cyclic admissions\" to hospitals and nursing homes because they cannot afford medication, housing, and food simultaneously, and so they prioritize housing and food.",
      "notableExperiences": "- **The \"Jitterbug vs. iPhone\" Analogy:** A powerful metaphor for how the Medicare system should be simplified for its target demographic, prioritizing ease-of-use over complex features.\n- **The \"Cat Food\" Anecdote:** The commenter has had seniors tell her that \"tuna cat food was cheaper than a brand name for people,\" a stark illustration of the extreme financial pressures some beneficiaries face.\n- **\"Cyclic Admissions\" Insight:** The professional observation that high medication costs directly lead to repeated hospitalizations, as seniors are forced to skip prescriptions to pay for food and housing.\n- **Medicare Advantage Denial Case Study:** A friend's mother in a dementia unit broke her hip and was denied skilled care and physical therapy by her MA plan because of her dementia diagnosis, despite being ambulatory before the fall. The family successfully appealed, but care was delayed.\n- **The Generational Squeeze:** The commenter notes that as original Medicare recipients age into their 80s, their children are now becoming Medicare-eligible themselves, creating a difficult situation where the \"sandwich generation\" must manage two generations of complex healthcare navigation at the same time.",
      "keyQuotations": "- \"Make is simple. Set it up like the Jitterbug phone and not like the iPhone.\"\n- \"I actually have had seniors tell me that tuna cat food was cheaper than a brand name for people. Eggs are their main cheap source of protein intake.\"\n- \"Medication prices cause them to have cyclic admissions into the hospital and skilled nursing centers as they cannot afford both medications, housing, and food. Housing and food are more important to them.\"",
      "detailedContent": "- Please revisit the requirement to sign up for Medicare A and B at age 65 or face a lifelong penalty.\n  - Most of us are not retiring at 65 but have to jump through hoops to sign up for health insurance we do not want or need.\n  - This would save the government money; let us sign up when we are ready to retire.\n- I now have Medicare A as secondary insurance, with my private work insurance as primary.\n- The system should be simple, like a Jitterbug phone, not a complex iPhone.\n  - As we age, we lose patience and the ability to filter our thoughts, so we are more easily angered by mandatory requirements for things we don't need.\n- As a lifelong geriatric nurse and MDS coordinator, I am now seeing the other side of this aging coin and understand why families were so frustrated with your system.\n- Just let us sign up for Medicare A and B when we are ready or in need of it.\n- The system is overloaded with unnecessary garbage, like my Medicare A and the Part B I had to cancel (I was not paying for it monthly in addition to my private insurance).\n- The monthly fine for seniors and the disabled who sign up late is well over $100.\n  - This is a lot of grocery, medication, or heat resources they need monthly.\n  - I have had seniors tell me that tuna cat food was cheaper than a brand name for people.\n  - Eggs are their main cheap source of protein.\n- High medication prices cause cyclic admissions to hospitals and skilled nursing centers because patients cannot afford medications, housing, and food.\n  - Housing and food are more important to them.\n- Medicare Advantage plans are not working as they should.\n  - They take away Medicare-entitled care. I fought with Advantage plans to get patients the care they earned and deserved.\n  - My retirement plan is to visit senior centers and challenge Advantage plans that prey on seniors who are alone, vulnerable, or cognitively impaired by lying about what their plans offer.\n    - **True Story:** A friend's mom, who lived in a dementia care unit, fell and broke her hip. Her Medicare Advantage plan denied skilled care and physical therapy due to her dementia.\n    - I asked if she was ambulatory before her fall, and she was.\n    - I directed my friend on the steps to appeal, and they won, but care was delayed by a few days.\n- In your technology foundation, please make it easy to use.\n  - Use picture icons if needed.\n  - Consider the family dynamic: If a patient is on Medicare, their spouse is a similar age. As they age into their 80s, their children become Medicare-aged, making it hard to manage both generations' care.\n- Consider using webinars to educate patients and responsible parties on their rights, instead of the hundreds of pages of the Medicare manual or the annual Medicare book.\n  - Many Medicare recipients misunderstand the annual book sent to them.\n  - The aging brain loses its ability to concentrate and comprehend what you are trying to communicate.\n  - Some learn better by watching or talking with someone than by reading.\n- Make it \"kid friendly.\"\n- Again, just let us sign up for Medicare A and B when we are ready and make it easier.\n- I had to spend a few hours at Social Security to verify Medicare A.\n  - They said they would need to cancel it because I have an HSA, but they never did.\n  - They did cancel Part B as I was still working.\n- All the information I read said we had to sign up at 65, so I did. I have the cards to prove it, should you decide to fine me monthly for signing up late when my husband retires and our private work insurance ends.\n- I have no issues appealing Medicare, as I have done this for decades for others."

      "oneLineSummary": "The CEO of a medical data platform company urges CMS to mandate access to real-time physiologic data from bedside monitors and prohibit vendor information blocking to unleash AI-driven patient safety and reduce hospital costs.",
      "commenterProfile": "- **Name/Organization:** Dr. Niraj Patel, DO MBA / Wavital\n- **Type:** Business\n- **Role/Expertise:** CEO & co-founder of a Class I Medical Device Data System (MDDS) platform that streams real-time physiologic waveforms and vitals from bedside monitors; DO, MBA.\n- **Geographic Scope:** National (based in Atlanta, GA)\n- **Stake in Issue:** His company, Wavital, provides the technology to stream and analyze the high-fidelity data he advocates for; regulatory changes would create a larger, more accessible market for his services.",
      "corePosition": "I am urging CMS and ONC to unlock real-time bedside data, stop the practice of warranty-based information blocking by device manufacturers, and create a voluntary AI-safety label. Taking these actions will reduce nurse workload, lower hospital penalties under value-based payment programs, and catalyze the development and adoption of safer AI at the bedside, particularly benefiting rural hospitals. The Health Technology Ecosystem RFI is a pivotal opportunity to move beyond intermittent charting toward continuous, high-fidelity data that can power next-generation AI and save lives.",
      "keyRecommendations": "- **Expand Data Standards:** Add continuous physiologic waveforms and vital signs at ≥1 Hz frequency to the USCDI and TEFCA frameworks by CY 2027, using IEEE 11073 terminology and HL7 v2 MDM for backward compatibility.\n- **Adopt SDC Transport Standard:** Require basic IEEE 11073 SDC \"plug-and-trust\" discovery and time-synchronization in the 2028 CEHRT update to eliminate proprietary, high-latency serial link connections from device vendors.\n- **Ban Warranty-Tied Data Blocking:**\n  - Declare OEM contract clauses that void warranties or demand \"unlock-fees\" for raw data access as *per se* information blocking.\n  - Add a \"warranty-neutral data access\" attestation requirement to CEHRT certification.\n  - Coordinate with the FTC on Section 5 enforcement against these anti-competitive practices.\n- **Create an AI Safety Label:** Establish a voluntary ONC certification track for clinical AI that includes provenance metadata, model-version logging, and post-market performance drift reporting.\n- **Establish a \"Physiology-at-Scale\" Sandbox:** Fund a CMS pilot program that posts de-identified, streaming physiologic data linked with claims data (in Bulk FHIR/NDJSON format) to create a national R&D resource for AI/ML development.\n- **Create a New Payment Add-On:** Introduce a DRG-neutral payment add-on for continuous physiologic surveillance, similar to existing add-ons for EEG or tele-ICU, to fund hospital adoption of MDDS-level data streaming and validated AI clinical decision support.\n- **Improve Alerting:** Connect the 2024 Provider-Access API rule to clinical alert endpoints so that high-acuity notifications (e.g., Shock Index > 1) can be delivered directly into EHR inboxes with a one-click acknowledgment feature.\n- **Form a Sub-Workgroup:** Convene a real-time data sub-workgroup under the new Digital Health Policy Committee to focus on these issues.",
      "mainConcerns": "- **Massive Data Loss:** Bedside monitors generate vast amounts of clinically valuable data (~26 million data points per patient per day), yet none of this real-time, high-fidelity data is currently accessible through CMS-mandated APIs.\n- **Information Blocking by OEMs:** Medical device manufacturers actively block access to raw data streams from their equipment.\n  - They use contractual clauses that void device warranties if hospitals allow third-party systems to access data ports.\n  - They charge exorbitant \"unlock-keys\" or \"high-fidelity license fees,\" costing up to $8,000 per bed per year.\n- **Throttled AI Potential:** The lack of real-time data severely limits the effectiveness of AI-powered early warning systems, forcing them to rely on intermittently charted data, which significantly lowers their predictive accuracy (AUROC 0.68 for MEWS vs. 0.86 with high-res data).\n- **Avoidable Patient Harm & Costs:** In-hospital patient deterioration costs the U.S. healthcare system $15 billion annually, and hospitals face significant VBP/HRRP penalties that could be reduced with better monitoring.\n- **Lack of Interoperability Standards:** Without a required standard like IEEE 11073 SDC for internal hospital device networks, hospitals are stuck with proprietary vendor solutions, serial \"data taps,\" and high-latency connections.",

      "keyQuotations": "- \"A single bedside monitor produces 26 million data points per patient-day; CMS APIs expose exactly zero of them.\"\n- \"Some OEMs charge up to $8k/bed/year for 'high-fidelity unlock keys' and threaten warranty loss if third-party gateways use RJ-45 ports—purely contractual lock-in that stifles rural hospitals and AI safety research.\"\n- \"Streaming physiology is the last mile between regulation and a rescued patient.\"",
      "detailedContent": "- I am Dr. Niraj Patel, DO, MBA, CEO and co-founder of Wavital, a U.S. Class I MDDS medical-device data platform.\n  - Wavital streams 300 Hz physiologic waveforms and continuous vital signs from multi-vendor bedside monitors into FHIR/HL7 pipelines in real time.\n  - Each patient-day generates over 26 million data points that can be converted into actionable analytics to avert ICU transfers and unplanned intubations.\n- The Health Technology Ecosystem RFI is a pivotal opportunity to move beyond intermittent charting toward continuous, high-fidelity data.\n  - This data can power next-generation AI early-warning systems, reduce nurse workload, and shrink the $15-billion annual cost of in-hospital deterioration.\n- **High-Impact Recommendations**\n  - **A. Expand USCDI and TEFCA:**\n    - Cover continuous waveforms and ≥1 Hz vital-sign channels (“USCDI-Vitals”) by CY 2027.\n    - Base the profile on IEEE 11073 nomenclature and HL7 v2 MDM segments for backward compatibility.\n    - Impact: Without waveform channels, AI models are throttled to 1-hour nurse charting. Wavital already normalizes 40+ proprietary packet formats, proving feasibility.\n  - **B. Adopt IEEE 11073 SDC:**\n    - Adopt the IEEE 11073 SDC family as the certified transport layer for point-of-care device networks.\n    - Require basic SDC “plug-and-trust” discovery and time sync in the 2028 CEHRT update.\n    - Impact: SDC delivers <25 ms latency and vendor-neutral control. Wavital bridges SDC streams to Bulk FHIR today, requiring no new bedside hardware.\n  - **C. Launch a CMS Pilot:**\n    - Launch a pilot that publishes de-identified Bulk FHIR/NDJSON streaming vitals linked to claims (“Physiology-at-Scale Sandbox”).\n    - Impact: Creates the first national R&D corpus for physiologic AI while protecting PHI.\n  - **D. Create a voluntary “Clinical AI Safety Label”:**\n    - Create this label inside the ONC Health-IT Certification Program.\n    - Require provenance metadata, model versioning, and post-market drift reporting.\n    - Impact: Mirrors aviation black-box thinking; Wavital already tracks model lineage.\n  - **E. Tie Provider-Access API to Alert Endpoints:**\n    - Ensure high-acuity notifications (e.g., Shock Index > 1) flow into EHR inboxes with one-click acknowledgment.\n    - Impact: Turns interoperability into bedside action and cuts alarm fatigue.\n  - **F. Introduce a DRG-neutral payment add-on:**\n    - Create an add-on for continuous physiologic surveillance (analogous to EEG or tele-ICU) to reward hospitals that adopt MDDS-level streaming and validated AI CDS.\n    - Impact: A 500-bed hospital can save $12-24M in VBP/HRRP penalties over five years.\n  - **G. Prohibit “license-tying” warranties:**\n    - Treat clauses that void warranties for exporting raw data as per se information blocking under PHSA §3022(a)(1).\n    - Require vendors to attest that warranty coverage is data-access-neutral.\n    - Impact: Some OEMs charge up to $8k/bed/year for “unlock keys” and use warranty threats for contractual lock-in, which stifles rural hospitals and AI safety research.\n- **Narrative Rationale**\n  - **The Data Gap:**\n    - A bedside monitor produces 26 million data points per patient-day, yet CMS APIs expose none of them.\n    - Studies show deep-learning early-warning systems achieve AUROC 0.86 versus 0.68 for MEWS and reduce alarm burden by >50%.\n  - **Why SDC Completes the Stack:**\n    - Bulk FHIR moves data out of the hospital; IEEE 11073 SDC moves data inside it.\n    - SDC provides self-describing APIs, mutual-TLS trust, and deterministic time sync, which are prerequisites for closed-loop AI.\n    - Without SDC, hospitals rely on serial “data taps” that add latency and violate warranties.\n    - Wavital already cross-maps SDC BICEPS descriptors to FHIR DeviceMetric.\n  - **Economic Rationale:**\n    - Avoidable deterioration events cost $15B annually.\n    - For a 500-bed hospital, a 6% swing in VBP and Readmission Penalties equals $12–$24 million over five years, enough to fund continuous monitoring and AI.\n  - **Information Blocking in Practice:**\n    - Several OEMs require paid “unlock licenses” or threaten warranty loss for waveform export.\n    - These clauses satisfy all three prongs of information blocking under 45 CFR §171.103.\n    - CMS should add a warranty-neutral data-access attestation to CEHRT, direct OIG to prioritize enforcement, and coordinate with the FTC on unfair-competition remedies.\n  - **Governance & Safety:**\n    - The proposed Clinical AI Safety Label would be updated via FHIR QuestionnaireResponse and piloted under ONC’s Real-World Testing framework, giving clinicians a living audit trail.\n- **Implementation Timeline (summary)**\n  - **2026:** Warranty-neutral attestation added to CEHRT; sandbox pilot launched.\n  - **2027:** USCDI-Vitals finalized; AI Safety Label voluntary certification.\n  - **2028:** SDC “plug-and-trust” discovery required in CEHRT; DRG add-on live.\n- **Closing**\n  - CMS and ONC have democratized claims and encounter data. Streaming physiology is the final step.\n  - I urge the agencies to convene a real-time data sub-workgroup under the new Digital Health Policy Committee and would be honored to serve on it."

      "corePosition": "We have developed a patent-pending platform, One & Done Smart Bids, that optimizes Medicare Advantage (MA) plan selection and can save 35.7 million enrollees $104 billion annually. Our tool empowers seniors, advances patient-centricity, and aligns with CMMI’s value-based care goals. We are seeking a no-cost CMMI pilot to prove our platform's ability to reduce costs and enhance beneficiary choice.",
      "keyRecommendations": "- **Conduct a No-Cost Pilot:** Launch a CMMI pilot of the One & Done Smart Bids platform to validate its effectiveness and savings potential.\n  - The company offers to absorb the administrative lift and only needs access to run scenarios with CMS sample data.\n- **Certify and Promote Consumer Apps:** CMS should certify effective consumer-facing health apps based on metrics like consumer savings and user satisfaction, and promote them on Medicare.gov.\n- **Enhance Blue Button 2.0:** Expand Blue Button 2.0 to include more comprehensive and timely data.\n  - Mandate real-time access to MA claims and health data.\n  - Include dental, vision, hearing, and complete formulary details.\n  - Incorporate social determinants of health data.\n- **Mandate Standardized APIs:** Require payers to use FHIR-based APIs, integrated via TEFCA, to ensure standardized and timely data access.\n- **Enforce Information Blocking Rules:** Enforce real-time data sharing from payers for MA claims and health data, and penalize non-compliance to prevent delays that hinder plan optimization.\n- **Incentivize ACO Adoption:** Offer bonuses through the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) for Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) that adopt cost-saving tools like One & Done Smart Bids.\n- **Improve Provider Directories:** Support the use of provider directories with FHIR endpoints to enable better matching between beneficiaries' preferred providers and available plans.",
      "mainConcerns": "- **Beneficiaries are in Misaligned Plans:** Millions of seniors are in plans that are a poor fit, causing them to overpay or be under-covered.\n- **Plan Selection is Overly Complex:** Seniors are often confused by the complexity of plan choices and misled by biased agent incentives, leading to inertia where they remain in the same plan year after year without re-evaluation.\n- **Information Blocking by Payers:** Payer delays in sharing MA claims and health data, with lags up to six months, and the use of proprietary APIs create significant barriers to real-time plan optimization for consumers.\n- **Inadequacy of Current Tools:** Existing health management apps lack the capability for real-time, all-in cost comparisons and integrated care navigation that our platform provides.",

Second, you should support the use of consistent and standardized terminology across all government agencies.",
      "keyRecommendations": "- **Bolster Patient Engagement and Trust:**\n  - **Expand Broadband Access:** Treat broadband access as a 'health-related social need', particularly for low-income, older, and rural populations who lack access but could benefit most from digital health tools.\n  - **Prioritize Mobile Platforms:** Leverage cellphones and smartphones as the primary platforms for digital health tools, as many users rely on them for internet access over computers.\n  - **Improve Health Literacy:**\n    - Involve patients in the development of digital health tools to ensure they are user-friendly.\n    - Use plain language in all communications.\n    - Develop educational materials like blogs and infographics to explain the basics, risks, and benefits of digital health tools.\n  - **Strengthen Privacy and Data Protection:**\n    - Require express informed consent from users regarding data collection, storage, use, and sharing.\n    - Replace long, legalistic \"terms of use\" agreements with plain language summaries, brief videos, or graphics to ensure true informed consent.\n    - Require compliance with HIPAA, 42 CFR Part 2, and state-level privacy laws, especially for behavioral health data.\n    - Establish cross-agency (ONC/ASTP, CMS, FTC, OCR) best practices or guidance on how to best inform patients about privacy and data use.\n    - Mandate adherence to cybersecurity best practices to secure data exchange protocols (like HL7 and FHIR) and consumer-facing apps.\n- **Standardize Terminology Across Government:**\n  - **Develop a Consistent Lexicon:** Agencies (including NIH, VA, CMS, FDA, SAMHSA, NIST) should collaborate to develop, standardize, and use consistent terminology for 'digital health' and related concepts like eHealth and AI.\n  - **Create a Federal Glossary:** Review existing definitions and create a comprehensive glossary of key terms that can be used across the federal government.\n  - **Consider International Standards:** Evaluate the World Health Organization’s definition of digital health as a potential model.",

      "keyQuotations": "- \"Long terms of use on Web sites or embedded in apps do not fully inform patients about how data will be collected and used and in and of themselves probably are not typically sufficient to educate consumers and obtain informed consent.\"\n- \"HL7 (Health Level Seven) and FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) are key standards for exchanging healthcare data. They ensure that different health information systems can communicate effectively and share information seamlessly.

Support use of consistent and standardized terminology across government agencies**\n  - It is axiomatic that agencies should carefully define the term 'digital health'.\n  - Many varying definitions are used by federal, private, and nonprofit sectors, leading to a lack of clarity, inconsistent regulation, and consumer misunderstanding.\n  - The RFI's definition of digital health products (\"digital tools that support individual health needs\") is not perfectly aligned with other definitions that include wellness or population health.\n  - While statutes may require specific terminology, agencies like NIH, VA, CMS, OSTP, FDA, SAMHSA, and NIST should develop, standardize, and use consistent terminology where feasible.\n  - Consistent terminology will support user engagement and spur innovation.\n  - **Recommendations for Standardization**\n    - ONC/ASTP, CMS, and others should review existing definitions and consider developing a glossary of key terms (e.g., eHealth, digital technologies, AI), potentially building on existing glossaries from ONC and NIST.\n    - An alternative could be to stop using terms like 'digital health', but for regulatory purposes, basic umbrella definitions are likely needed.\n    - A starting point for a definition could be the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Strategy on Digital Health, which defines it as \"'[t]he field of knowledge and practice associated with the development and use of digital technologies to improve health.'\"\n      - This definition expands on eHealth and includes the Internet of Things, AI, big data, and robotics.\n    - A literature review concluded that digital health is \"about the proper use of technology for improving the health and wellbeing of people at individual and population levels.\"\n  - **Examples of Inconsistent Definitions**\n    - In the 2025 Physician Fee Schedule, CMS defined \"digital mental health technology\" to mean FDA-cleared/approved software for treating mental health conditions.\n    - CMS has also used the term 'digital cognitive behavioral therapy' and referenced SAMHSA’s definition of \"digital therapeutics.\"\n    - ONC/ASTP's Strategic Plan defines \"digital therapeutics\" as a subset of digital health tools delivering evidence-based interventions via software, but its glossary doesn't define 'digital health'.\n    - The FDA has defined \"digital health technology\" as a system using computing platforms, software, and/or sensors for healthcare uses, spanning from wellness to medical devices."

      "corePosition": "While digital health technologies offer significant benefits, it's crucial to address the digital divide for seniors who face challenges with digital literacy and physical impairments. To ensure equitable and effective healthcare, CMS must create user-friendly solutions, address the shortage of specialists like endocrinologists, and streamline processes by eliminating wasteful requirements like redundant diagnostic tests for my long-established Type 1 Diabetes.",
      "keyRecommendations": "- **Improve Digital Accessibility for Seniors:**\n  - Implement user-friendly interfaces specifically tailored for seniors.\n  - Provide training programs to enhance seniors' digital literacy.\n  - Ensure alternative support channels, like telephone assistance, are available.\n  - Create a diverse test group (seniors, younger people, medical staff) to evaluate health tech usability before deployment.\n- **Address Workforce Shortages:**\n  - Incentivize training programs to increase the number of endocrinologists and diabetes nurse educators.\n  - Use telehealth to expand the reach of existing specialists.\n  - Integrate community health workers to provide localized support.\n- **Streamline Health Information & Processes:**\n  - Support the development of tools that translate complex medical data into insights patients can understand.\n  - Discontinue the Medicare requirement for redundant blood tests to re-confirm long-established Type 1 Diabetes diagnoses for new enrollees.\n    - This practice increases costs with no clinical benefit for patients with decades-long medical histories.\n    - Medicare should instead reference pre-existing medical records.\n- **Prepare for the Baby Boomer Generation:**\n  - Expand programs focused on chronic disease management.\n  - Invest in preventive care initiatives.\n  - Encourage the development of technologies that support aging in place.",

      "detailedContent": "- **1. Addressing the Digital Divide Among Seniors**\n  - While digital health technologies offer significant benefits, many seniors face challenges in adopting these tools due to factors like limited digital literacy, cognitive impairments, and physical disabilities.\n  - To ensure equitable access, CMS should consider:\n    - Implementing user-friendly interfaces tailored for seniors.\n    - Providing training programs to enhance digital literacy.\n    - Ensuring availability of alternative support channels, such as telephonic assistance.\n  - I recommend establishing a test group including seniors, younger individuals, and medical staff to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of health technology applications.\n    - This diverse feedback on real-world functionality would improve design, reduce frustration, and increase adoption.\n- **2. Shortage of Endocrinologists and Diabetes Nurse Educators**\n  - The rising prevalence of diabetes among the aging population highlights the need for specialized care.\n  - A notable shortage of endocrinologists and diabetes nurse educators impedes effective disease management.\n  - CMS could explore:\n    - Incentivizing training programs to increase the workforce in these specialties.\n    - Leveraging telehealth to extend the reach of existing specialists.\n    - Integrating community health workers to provide localized support.\n- **3. Enhancing Access to Health Records**\n  - Empowering patients with their health records is commendable, but interpreting this information is challenging for many seniors without professional support.\n  - To bridge this gap, CMS could:\n    - Support developing tools that translate complex medical data into understandable insights.\n    - Facilitate collaborations between patients and care coordinators to interpret health information.\n  - As someone with Type 1 Diabetes for nearly 70 years, I know how vital access to accurate, up-to-date records is.\n    - I use multiple health record applications, which is confusing when different practices use different platforms.\n    - I commend Trinity Health for doing an excellent job integrating and maintaining my records.\n  - I suggest a cost-saving improvement for Medicare: stop requiring redundant blood tests to reconfirm a long-established Type 1 Diabetes diagnosis when a person transitions to Medicare.\n    - These tests increase costs without clinical benefit for those who have managed T1D for decades.\n    - Medicare could instead reference the individual's pre-existing medical records, which already document the diagnosis.\n    - This would also help hospitals and nursing homes quickly differentiate between Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes to improve adherence to ADA treatment guidelines.\n- **4. Preparing for the Needs of the Baby Boomer Generation**\n  - The Baby Boomer generation is entering a phase where chronic conditions are more prevalent.\n  - To meet their healthcare needs, CMS should:\n    - Expand programs focused on chronic disease management.\n    - Invest in preventive care initiatives.\n    - Encourage developing technologies that support aging in place."

      "corePosition": "Psychiatry and psychology have fully embraced an entrepreneurial spirit, but not in a positive way. We believe the mental health industry is a business that profits by inventing new disorders and targeting new customer pools, like entrepreneurs and minorities, rather than curing anyone.

      "corePosition": "We believe CMS should provide one universal Electronic Medical Record (EMR) for all provider types. A single, unified system would dramatically improve care outcomes, decrease hospitalizations, and create huge cost savings by giving all clinicians the \"whole picture\" of a patient's health, eliminating duplicate work and streamlining processes across the entire healthcare system.",

      "mainConcerns": "- **Prohibitive EMR Costs:** The cost of EMR software is extremely expensive for small providers, consuming approximately 20% of the commenter's agency revenue.\n- **Fragmented Care:** Patients' medical information is scattered across numerous, disconnected EMR systems, preventing any single provider from having a complete view of their medications, diagnoses, and history.\n- **Poor Patient Outcomes:** Incomplete information leads to poorer care outcomes and preventable hospitalizations.\n- **Systemic Inefficiency and Waste:**\n  - Lack of shared data results in duplicate lab tests and other redundant procedures.\n  - Clinicians are forced to focus on duplicate data entry and \"paper pushing\" instead of direct patient care.\n  - Talented clinical staff are being diverted into \"DATA Management\" roles to handle administrative burdens.\n- **Slow and Insecure Data Exchange:** The current system of sharing data is slow (\"snail speed\") and creates security vulnerabilities, especially when sharing documentation for authorizations.",

Structural Barriers to Innovation in Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs)**\n  - Current federal regulations were built for episodic, fee-for-service care.\n  - SNFs operate in a relationship-driven, highly variable environment where top-down mandates do not translate into consistent frontline execution.\n  - Barriers include:\n    - Medicaid reimbursement that limits investment in tech infrastructure.\n    - Staff shortages and wage constraints that reduce bandwidth for innovation.\n    - Lack of interoperability with hospital systems and care partners.\n    - Manual, burdensome reporting requirements that take time away from care.\n- **2. What CMS Can Do**\n  - **A. Build Interoperability Incentives for SNFs**\n    - Include SNFs in future funding opportunities for EHR upgrades, real-time data sharing tools, and care coordination platforms.\n    - Interoperability cannot begin and end in the hospital setting.\n  - **B. Align Metrics With Operational Reality**\n    - Outcome expectations must account for social determinants, staff capacity, and resource limitations.\n    - If SNFs are to be held accountable for value-based outcomes, the tools and supports must match the demand.\n  - **C. Include Post-Acute Stakeholders in Policy Design**\n    - Invite SNF leaders, frontline clinicians, and post-acute partners into CMS advisory and pilot program design teams.\n    - No one can speak more clearly to implementation challenges than those operating under them daily.\n  - **D. Streamline Compliance Without Diluting Accountability**\n    - Reporting should serve improvement, not paperwork.\n    - Create regulatory flexibility that enables facilities to innovate without fearing noncompliance for reasonable variation.\n- **Conclusion**\n  - Skilled nursing facilities are essential to value-based care success, especially in preventing avoidable hospitalizations, managing complex transitions, and supporting aging populations.\n  - We are ready to lead, but cannot do so without support, inclusion, and systems that reflect how we actually deliver care."

      "oneLineSummary": "A patient-advocate and healthcare consultant, drawing from personal experience with a fragmented system, calls for a National Safe Harbor for Real-World Interoperability Testing to create a unified system that centers patients and integrates pharmacy workflows.",
      "commenterProfile": "- **Name/Organization:** Kelee Petzelt (also associated with Point of Care Partners and NCPDP collaborations)\n- **Type:** Other (Patient Advocate and Health Care Industry Consultant)\n- **Role/Expertise:** Patient Advocate; Healthcare Consultant; Co-author of precision medicine and pharmacy interoperability white papers; expertise in pharmacogenomics (PGx), interoperability standards (NCPDP, HL7), and patient-centered care.\n- **Geographic Scope:** National (based in AL)\n- **Stake in Issue:** Was personally misdiagnosed, delayed, and dismissed due to a fragmented healthcare system, which led to a \"years-long journey through silos, policy gaps, and out-of-pocket costs\" and now informs her professional advocacy for system-level change.",
      "corePosition": "I never set out to fix healthcare—I just wanted to survive it. My personal experience with misdiagnosis and delays caused by a fragmented system has shown me that we must stop asking patients to stitch their own care together and instead build a system that is unified by design. My goal is to urge us to do better by centering patients, including pharmacy, and aligning health technology with outcomes, not optics, because people are dying from a lack of connection, not a lack of technology.",
      "keyRecommendations": "- **Establish a National Safe Harbor for Real-World Interoperability Testing:** Create permanent infrastructure, not another pilot, to validate essential connections for patients, providers, and pharmacists, including PGx, ePA, RTBC, DTx, and pharmacy-centered workflows.\n- **Develop a Dual-Path Strategy for Pharmacy Data Exchange:** Support and enhance data exchange methods (e.g., PeCP, HL7 CDex, APIs) that align with the different needs of various pharmacy settings (community, retail, etc.).\n- **Advocate for Comprehensive Pharmacist Reimbursement:** Collaborate with CMS and payers to develop sustainable reimbursement models for clinical services and create incentive programs for pharmacies to invest in interoperability technology.\n- **Expand Education and Training on Interoperability:** Increase awareness and understanding of interoperability standards and technologies among pharmacists, staff, and pharmacy schools.\n- **Define a Minimum Data Set for Exchange:** Work with stakeholders to identify the core data elements (medication lists, allergies, care plans) that should be exchanged between pharmacies and providers to support coordinated care.\n- **Promote Collaboration:** Facilitate stronger collaboration between pharmacy technology vendors, HIEs/QHINs, and standards organizations like NCPDP and HL7.\n- **Implement Advanced Documentation and Billing Solutions:** Promote the adoption of sophisticated systems that can handle complex clinical services and varied payment models, including AI-assisted tools.\n- **Develop a Certification Program for Pharmacy Systems:** Create a standardized certification process for pharmacy management systems, similar to EHR certification, to ensure they meet interoperability, clinical documentation, and patient safety standards.\n- **Prepare for Advanced Technology:** Develop guidelines for the responsible integration of AI and machine learning in pharmacy practice.\n- **Promote Flexible, Modular Pharmacy Systems:** Encourage the development of customizable pharmacy management systems that can accommodate various workflows, services, and contract requirements.",
      "mainConcerns": "- **System Fragmentation Harms Patients:** The healthcare system is a collection of silos with policy gaps that forces patients to stitch together their own care, leading to misdiagnosis, treatment delays, and poor outcomes.\n- **Lack of Meaningful Interoperability:** Technology and standards exist but are not widely or effectively adopted. Critical data, such as clinical notes from pharmacists (PeCP), is not being ingested or used by provider EHRs, creating a gap in the patient record.\n- **Flawed Financial Incentives:** Current payment models fail to reimburse pharmacists for clinical services or incentivize investment in interoperability. This allows large corporations and PBMs to profit while community pharmacies close, creating \"pharmacy deserts.\"\n- **Inaction on Known Problems:** For over a decade, the industry has studied and documented problems like pharmacy deserts, but has taken little action to fix them, allowing them to worsen.\n- **Patient Data is at Risk and Not Controlled by Patients:** Major data breaches (e.g., Change Healthcare) highlight significant vulnerabilities, especially with third-party vendors. Patients are not informed transparently or promptly, and the rise of for-profit QHINs raises concerns that patient data will be used for corporate profit rather than care.\n- **Pharmacies Are Excluded and Underutilized:** Pharmacies are central to patient care but are often left out of interoperability initiatives. Their systems lack certification, and their clinical contributions are not integrated into the broader healthcare ecosystem.",
      "notableExperiences": "- **Personal Misdiagnosis as a Catalyst:** The commenter's advocacy began after a personal health crisis where a \"simple pharmacogenomic test became a years-long journey through silos, policy gaps, and out-of-pocket costs,\" demonstrating the real-world harm of a disconnected system.\n- **Lived Experience in a \"Pharmacy Desert\":** \"There were times I had to choose between my own medications and what my kids needed. I chose my kids — every time. Because when you live in a pharmacy desert, healthcare isn’t a service. It’s a gamble.\"\n- **Insight on Medication Adherence:** The commenter reframes non-adherence as a rational response to an irrational system, stating, \"Compliance Isn’t Rational in a Desert.\" Patients cannot adhere to care plans if they lack access to pharmacies or cannot afford their medication.\n- **Specific System Failure Identified:** A key insight from the white paper is that even when pharmacists use tools like the Pharmacist eCare Plan (PeCP) to document clinical interventions, providers' EHRs are often unable to ingest or use this data, breaking the communication loop.\n- **Metaphor for Healthcare's Structure:** The submission repeatedly uses the analogy of pharmacies being the \"heart\" of healthcare, with standards bodies like NCPDP providing the \"veins\" or \"circulatory system\" for the vital data that needs to flow throughout the system.",
      "keyQuotations": "- \"I never set out to fix healthcare—I just wanted to survive it.\"\n- \"Because people aren’t dying from lack of technology—they’re dying from a lack of connection.\"\n- \"There were times I had to choose between my own medications and what my kids needed.

      "detailedContent": "- **Summary of Formal Response**\n  - My personal experience with misdiagnosis and dismissal, caused by a fragmented system, has given me purpose to advocate for change.\n  - A simple pharmacogenomic (PGx) test turned into a years-long journey through silos and policy gaps.\n  - My submission calls for a National Safe Harbor for Real-World Interoperability Testing as permanent infrastructure.\n    - This should validate connections for PGx, ePA, RTBC, DTx, and pharmacy-centered workflows.\n  - We must stop asking patients to stitch their care together and build a system that is unified by design.\n  - People are dying from a lack of connection, not a lack of technology.\n\n- **Precision Medicine Executive Summary (Co-authored by commenter)**\n  - **Purpose:** To outline the importance of a pharmacist-led pharmacogenomic (PGx) solution and how NCPDP standards can advance Precision Medicine.\n  - **Understanding Precision Medicine**\n    - PGx helps identify responders and non-responders to medications, avoid adverse events, and optimize drug doses.\n    - It allows for individualized medication selection, dosing optimization, avoidance of adverse drug reactions, and prediction of treatment response.\n    - As many as 25-50% of prescribed medications are not therapeutically effective, costing the U.S. up to $528.4 billion annually.\n  - **Benefits of Precision Medicine in Pharmacy**\n    - Aligns with value-based care by enabling targeted, cost-effective therapies.\n    - Pharmacists are a trusted source of information, and integrating PGx into pharmacy workflows can improve patient outcomes.\n    - Helps prevent adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and enhances medication safety.\n  - **Value of Standardized Pharmacist-Led PGx Solutions**\n    - Standardization is crucial for consistency in reporting, clinical guidelines, education, and regulatory compliance.\n    - Effective data integration and interoperability are key to success.\n  - **NCPDP's Involvement & Stakeholder Action Group (SAG) Takeaways**\n    - NCPDP has a Pharmacogenomics Task Group and has hosted webinars on the topic.\n    - A SAG meeting identified key barriers and solutions across different industry segments (Payer/PBM, Pharmacy, PGx Orgs, Vendors).\n    - **Common Barriers:** Ambiguous payment models, need for greater education for all stakeholders (including patients), lack of PGx standards for labs, and lack of data interoperability (who houses the data and how is it accessed).\n    - **Potential Solutions:** Value-based contracts, pre-test authorization, data interoperability via NCPDP standards, and advocating for pharmacists' role in PGx.\n  - **Future Considerations**\n    - Key questions remain: Where does the data live? How is it made available to others?\n    - Need for pilots using existing NCPDP standards (SCRIPT, Telecom, ePA, RTPB).\n    - Need to define minimum data requirements and collaborate with other standards bodies.\n\n- **Pharmacy Interoperability White Paper (Primary Submission)**\n  - **Executive Summary & Key Takeaways**\n    - The pharmacy sector is transforming, but technology interoperability lags.\n    - Evolving pharmacy practice requires better data exchange.\n    - Challenges include outdated systems, inconsistent standards adoption (e.g., HL7 PeCP), and lack of financial incentives.\n    - NCPDP's leadership is essential, but it should expand its role in promoting standards adoption.\n  - **Current State of Pharmacy Technology Interoperability**\n    - **Landscape:** Many pharmacies lack the infrastructure for clinical information exchange. Technology is available, but actual sharing is limited by lack of demand, poor reimbursement models, and partner systems' inability to consume pharmacy data.\n    - **Challenges by Type:** Community pharmacies have limited resources; chains face corporate policy hurdles; specialty pharmacies are more advanced but still struggle with standardization.\n    - **Limitations of Existing Systems:** Most Pharmacy Management Systems (PMS) were designed for dispensing, not clinical services. They lack robust documentation features, integration capabilities, and support for complex billing.\n    - **Certification of Pharmacy Systems:** Unlike EHRs, pharmacy systems have no standardized certification process (like the ASTP Health IT Certification). This leads to interoperability challenges, variable quality, and safety concerns. Work is underway to update the HL7 EHR-System Functional Profile for pharmacies.\n  - **Quality, Payment, and Data Exchange**\n    - **Quality Measurement:** Efforts to develop pharmacy-specific quality measures are hindered by data collection challenges and lack of standardization.\n    - **Payment Complexities:** Diverse and complex payment models (fee-for-service, value-based, direct contracting) require sophisticated systems that most pharmacies lack.\n    - **Clinical Data Exchange:** Pharmacists want to engage but face barriers: lack of incentives, operational constraints, and the inability of providers' EHRs to consume data from the Pharmacist eCare Plan (PeCP).\n  - **Readiness Assessment**\n    - **Vendors:** Have developed capabilities but see limited demand due to a lack of financial incentives for pharmacies.\n    - **Pharmacies:** Are interested but hindered by resource constraints, workflow disruption, and EHR integration challenges.\n    - **HIEs/QHINs:** Are beginning to engage with pharmacies, but connections are minimal. There is ambiguity about how TEFCA will incorporate pharmacies.\n  - **Recommendations (See \"KEY RECOMMENDATIONS\" section above for summary)**\n    - The paper details nine specific, actionable recommendations for the industry.\n\n- **Personal Commentary: Pharmacy Deserts**\n  - We can't improve healthcare access when the foundation is broken.\n  - Over 15.8 million Americans live in \"pharmacy deserts,\" a problem identified in 2014 that has only gotten worse, with over 9,000 pharmacies closing since then.\n  - This is not due to a shortage of money, but a redistribution of it to PBMs and corporate giants who have seen record profits (cites CVS, UnitedHealth, Cigna).\n  - My personal experience: I had to choose between my medications and my kids' needs.\n  - Measuring social determinants of health is not enough; we need action.\n  - Patient non-adherence is not irresponsibility; it's a result of inaccessibility. \"Compliance Isn’t Rational in a Desert.\"\n\n- **Personal Commentary: Health Data Security & Control**\n  - **Hackers, Hospitals, and Hope:**\n    - Our health data is vulnerable. Over 85% of stolen records come from third parties (billing companies, vendors), not hospitals.\n    - Underserved and rural hospitals lack the resources for robust cybersecurity, making their patients' data an easy target.\n    - Patients must advocate for themselves by asking questions about data protection and being cautious about sharing information.\n  - **Your Health Data Should Serve You, Not Profits:**\n    - Networks like CommonWell and frameworks like TEFCA aim to improve data sharing, but the entry of for-profit QHINs raises questions about who controls and profits from patient data.\n    - The Change Healthcare data breach is a cautionary tale: 100 million Americans were affected, but notifications were delayed for months, leaving patients vulnerable and uninformed.\n    - Healthcare mergers create new security risks and consolidate patient data in ways we are not informed about.\n    - Patients need control over their own health data—to access it, choose who sees it, and understand how it's used."

      "corePosition": "I believe Medicare should embrace a philosophy of \"wholeness\" by focusing on disease prevention and root causes, rather than just masking symptoms with conventional cures. We need to integrate body, mind, and spirit by promoting natural healing, better nutrition, and holistic care like Naturopathy. Let's get down to the whole system and find out what is causing disease instead of just sticking a band-aid on it.",
      "keyRecommendations": "- Provide accurate, comprehensive information on disease prevention, resolving conflicts between the conventional healthcare industry and natural healing methods.\n- Promote nutrition as preventive medicine by:\n  - Creating a new food pyramid.\n  - Educating seniors on using food and natural herbs for health.\n  - Removing processed foods, chemicals, glyphosates, and corn syrup from the food supply.\n  - Limiting salt and sugar in foods sold to the public.\n- Expand and support Telehealth, recognizing its necessity for disabled, elderly, and rural populations.\n- Require Medicare health plans to provide transportation to medical appointments, mirroring the benefit available through Medicaid.\n- Ensure over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications remain affordable.\n- Create incentives for patients who participate in preventive health and maintenance programs to lower long-term costs.\n- Integrate and provide coverage for Naturopathic and Homeopathic medical care to address the root causes of illness.",
      "mainConcerns": "- The public receives conflicting information about health from the conventional healthcare industry versus natural healing proponents.\n- The American food supply contains harmful substances like processed ingredients, chemicals, glyphosates, corn syrup, and excessive salt and sugar.\n- The current healthcare system focuses on masking symptoms with \"band-aid\" cures instead of identifying and addressing the root causes of disease.\n- Seniors and disabled individuals lack access to transportation for medical appointments, which is an essential barrier to receiving good care.\n- The healthcare system fails to treat the whole person, ignoring how mental and spiritual issues can manifest as physical illness.",
      "notableExperiences": "- The comment makes a direct and compelling policy comparison by pointing out that Medicaid provides transportation to appointments while Medicare largely does not, highlighting a critical gap for seniors and the disabled.\n- It advocates for a paradigm shift from symptom management to a \"wholeness\" model that integrates body, mind, and spirit, arguing that many illnesses \"begin in the mind and manifest in the body.\"\n- The commenter extends the concept of individual \"wholeness\" to a critique of societal institutions, suggesting that our collective progress is \"languishing\" because our systems are fragmented and fail to address root causes.",

      "oneLineSummary": "The CEO of a health tech company and founder of one of the first QHINs advocates for mandating TEFCA participation, universal digital identity, and open FHIR APIs to build a truly interoperable and equitable healthcare data ecosystem.",
      "commenterProfile": "- **Name/Organization:** Steve Yaskin, CEO, beHuman Corp.\n- **Type:** Business\n- **Role/Expertise:** Founder and CEO of beHuman Corp., an AI-powered preventive care company. Previously founder and CEO of Health Gorilla, one of the first designated Qualified Health Information Networks (QHINs™) under TEFCA™.\n- **Geographic Scope:** National\n- **Stake in Issue:** His company's business model, which delivers preventive care to underserved populations, is built directly upon the national health data infrastructure (TEFCA, APIs) discussed in the RFI.",
      "corePosition": "I advocate for mandatory TEFCA participation, universal digital identity through CSPs, and open access to interoperable health data as foundational pillars for the health technology ecosystem. CMS must transition from optional frameworks to mandatory infrastructure to support a patient-centered, digitally enabled healthcare system. With TEFCA, CSP-backed digital identity, and AI-driven UX, the tools needed to democratize access and empower patients are not only possible but essential.",
      "keyRecommendations": "- **Mandate TEFCA Participation:** Require all CMS-contracted entities—including payers (MA, MCOs, QHPs), major labs (e.g., LabCorp, Quest), and certified EHR vendors—to participate in TEFCA.\n- **Establish Universal Digital Identity:** Mandate the use of NIST-compliant Credential Service Providers (CSPs) like Login.gov or ID.me for patients and providers to enable secure, single sign-on access across all health apps and portals.\n- **Enforce Open, Standardized APIs:**\n  - Mandate certified FHIR APIs for administrative workflows like scheduling, patient intake, and provider directories.\n  - Transition quality reporting from the burdensome QRDA format to automated submissions via Bulk FHIR APIs.\n- **Strengthen Information Blocking Enforcement:**\n  - Tighten the \"Infeasibility\" and \"Content and Manner\" exceptions to prevent abuse.\n  - Classify a refusal to participate in TEFCA without legitimate justification as a form of constructive information blocking.\n- **Expand CMS's Role as an Ecosystem Enabler:**\n  - Create and maintain a national, publicly funded provider directory with verified FHIR endpoints.\n  - Launch a CMS-backed interoperability sandbox for developers to test apps against real-world data standards.\n  - Establish a \"Trusted CMS-Connected\" registry to certify and promote digital health tools that meet standards for usability, equity, and TEFCA integration.",
      "mainConcerns": "- **Voluntary TEFCA Adoption:** The voluntary nature of TEFCA, especially among payers and labs, severely limits the completeness of patient data and undermines the goal of a nationwide exchange.\n- **Data Fragmentation and Silos:** Patients lack a single, consolidated view of their health information, forcing them to piece together data from disparate EHR portals, lab systems, and payer apps, which impairs care coordination.\n- **Inconsistent and Proprietary Standards:** The widespread use of proprietary APIs, inconsistent FHIR implementations, and outdated protocols like Direct Secure Messaging create significant development burdens and prevent scalable innovation.\n- **Burdensome Administrative and Reporting Workflows:** Providers are burdened by manual, redundant quality reporting processes (e.g., QRDA) and administrative workflows (e.g., intake, scheduling) that are not interoperable.\n- **Digital Inequity:** Many digital health tools and identity verification processes are inaccessible to elderly, disabled, non-English-speaking, or low-literacy populations, widening the digital divide.",
      "notableExperiences": "- **Real-World TEFCA Application:** The commenter's company, beHuman Corp., uses its TEFCA-connected infrastructure to pull clinical records for cancer screening eligibility, even for patients who lack a primary care provider, demonstrating how national interoperability can directly serve underserved populations.\n- **From Building the Pipes to Using Them:** The commenter offers a unique dual perspective, having founded one of the first QHINs (Health Gorilla) that built the \"pipes\" for data exchange, and now running a company (beHuman) that uses those pipes for clinical care delivery.\n- **Defining Information Blocking Broadly:** A novel policy recommendation is to define \"refusal to participate in TEFCA\" as a form of constructive information blocking, arguing that entities choosing to remain outside the national framework materially limit data access.\n- **The Role of QHINs Beyond Data Routing:** He posits that TEFCA trust communities (QHINs) should evolve to become \"identity and consent infrastructure providers, not just data routers,\" streamlining access and reducing burden for the entire ecosystem.\n- **Unlocking Unstructured Data:** The comment repeatedly emphasizes that true interoperability requires access to all data formats—including scanned documents, faxes, and free-text notes—and that this is a \"clinical necessity,\" not a luxury.",
      "keyQuotations": "- \"CMS must transition from optional frameworks to mandatory infrastructure to support a patient-centered, digitally enabled healthcare system.\"\n- \"Access to all EHR data formats is not a luxury—it is a clinical necessity. Unlocking this data through TEFCA, combined with identity-driven consent models and modern data transformation tools, will elevate interoperability from a regulatory requirement to a true enabler of high-quality, equitable care nationwide.\"\n- \"Refusing to onboard to TEFCA without legitimate technical, legal, or financial justification should constitute a form of constructive information blocking.\"\n- \"TEFCA trust communities should evolve into identity and consent infrastructure providers, not just data routers.\"",
      "detailedContent": "- **Introduction**\n  - I am Steve Yaskin, Founder and CEO of beHuman Corp., a healthcare technology company delivering AI-powered preventive care to underserved populations.\n  - Previously, I founded and was CEO of Health Gorilla, one of the first designated Qualified Health Information Networks (QHINs™) under TEFCA™.\n  - My leadership at Health Gorilla helped shape the national health information exchange infrastructure.\n  - beHuman builds on this infrastructure, using TEFCA to connect data and enable timely screening and care coordination.\n  - I advocate for mandatory TEFCA participation, universal digital identity through CSPs, and open access to interoperable health data.\n- **PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS (PC)**\n  - **PC-1. What health management or care navigation apps would be helpful?**\n    - The most impactful apps would offer real-time, longitudinal access to clinical, behavioral, and benefit data in a single, AI-powered interface via TEFCA.\n    - These tools should be \"virtual care navigators\" providing proactive guidance, such as screening reminders, follow-up alerts, and benefit information.\n    - Ideal app features:\n      - Automatically pull labs, diagnoses, medications, and procedures.\n      - Surface personalized health recommendations.\n      - Send reminders for preventive care.\n      - Verify insurance coverage and costs.\n      - Enable direct scheduling and digital intake.\n      - Allow proxy access for caregivers.\n    - An AI-powered personal health assistant should be able to:\n      - Summarize medical history and identify trends.\n      - Schedule necessary screenings and tests.\n      - Review benefits and help avoid out-of-pocket costs.\n      - Monitor for changes in care plans or eligibility.\n      - Translate clinical terminology.\n      - Coordinate follow-up with specialists.\n  - **PC-2. Do you have easy access to all health information in one location?**\n    - No, most patients do not. We are forced to piece together fragmented data from disparate EHR portals, pharmacy apps, lab portals, and insurance platforms.\n    - In rare cases where aggregation is possible (e.g., Apple Health), benefits include faster emergency decision-making, avoidance of duplicate tests, and improved care transitions.\n    - A single portal would be most valuable for:\n      - Managing multiple chronic conditions.\n      - Coordinating care for elderly parents or children (proxy access).\n      - Navigating care transitions (e.g., hospital discharge).\n      - Participating in value-based care programs.\n    - Data types often unavailable include: radiology images, pathology/genetic results, behavioral health/SDOH data, and historical care plans.\n    - Obstacles include: lack of TEFCA participation, EHRs with limited APIs, fragmented identity systems, and low digital literacy.\n    - **Recommendation:** CMS should mandate TEFCA participation for all contracted payers and certified EHR vendors, enforce digital identity credentialing (e.g., Login.gov), and require user-friendly data consolidation in third-party apps.\n  - **PC-3. Are you aware of useful apps for Medicare beneficiaries?**\n    - Yes, especially apps certified under CMS’s TEFCA Individual Access Services (IAS) framework.\n    - TEFCA IAS-certified apps can offer comprehensive access to clinical, claims, and social determinants data.\n    - Examples of promising applications: Health Gorilla’s Patient360, Apple Health, Google’s Health Connect, and Medicare Blue Button-enabled apps.\n    - CMS certification of these tools would signal trustworthiness and ensure privacy and security standards.\n  - **PC-4. What features are missing from current apps?**\n    - Most apps lack integrated, actionable features. Key missing capabilities include:\n      - Access to complete, longitudinal health records.\n      - Real-time insurance eligibility and cost transparency.\n      - Smart care navigation with proactive next steps.\n      - Seamless scheduling across different systems.\n      - Support for caregiver proxies.\n      - Accessibility features for underserved populations.\n    - Apps that should exist but don't:\n      - A TEFCA-enabled care navigation app aggregating clinical, benefit, and cost data with real-time scheduling.\n      - A caregiver dashboard for managing multiple dependents.\n      - A benefits-integrated screening manager.\n    - These don't exist due to: lack of mandatory TEFCA participation, no universal digital identity, fragmented APIs, and limited CMS policy support.\n    - CMS is uniquely positioned to offer cross-payer/provider workflows like longitudinal care gap analysis, screening/vaccination tracking, real-time ADT notifications, and equity dashboards.\n  - **PC-5. How can CMS encourage patient interest in digital health products?**\n    - CMS must focus on usability, trust, and value clarity.\n    - CMS should:\n      - Certify and promote tools meeting national standards.\n      - Mandate accessibility features (multilingual, large text, proxy access).\n      - Tie adoption to real value (e.g., reduced costs, faster appointments).\n      - Publicly score apps on accessibility, equity features, and TEFCA integration.\n    - CMS should play a role as a signaler of quality and trust by maintaining a \"Trusted CMS-Connected\" registry for apps that integrate with TEFCA/QHINs, use CSP-backed identity, and demonstrate usability and positive impact.\n    - To enable timely data access, CMS should mandate TEFCA participation for all Medicare-contracted entities, publish real-time FHIR APIs for claims and benefits, and establish a national identity and consent service.\n  - **PC-6. What features are most important for accessibility for Medicare beneficiaries?**\n    - 1. Large, high-contrast text and intuitive navigation.\n    - 2. Multilingual support.\n    - 3. Offline or low-bandwidth functionality (including SMS/voice).\n    - 4. Voice and touch interaction options.\n    - 5. Proxy access and shared dashboards.\n    - 6. Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum).\n    - 7. Simple onboarding using federated digital identity (e.g., Login.gov).\n    - 8. Educational content in plain language.\n    - Accessibility must be integrated into the certification process for any CMS-endorsed product.\n  - **PC-7. How can CMS collect real-world data on digital health product outcomes?**\n    - CMS should leverage TEFCA infrastructure, FHIR APIs, and claims data to link product usage with measurable outcomes.\n    - The framework should include:\n      - TEFCA-enabled, de-identified usage monitoring.\n      - Linking app usage to CMS claims data to measure outcomes like reduced hospitalizations or completed screenings.\n      - Establishing a CMS Real-World Data (RWD) clearinghouse or dashboard for benchmarking.\n      - Using standardized outcome definitions and APIs.\n      - Incorporating patient-reported outcomes (PROs).\n  - **PC-8. What health data is valuable and available vs. hard to access?**\n    - Readily available data includes medication history, basic lab results, and appointment summaries, but it is scattered and not proactive.\n    - Valuable but hard-to-access data includes encounter notes, discharge summaries, radiology images, pathology results, SDOH data, and real-time benefit/prior-auth status.\n    - Barriers are lack of mandatory TEFCA participation, limited FHIR API adoption, no shared patient identity, and vendor reluctance.\n    - High-value non-clinical data includes SDOH, remote monitoring/wearable data, and community-based services data.\n    - Opportunities to improve integration: mandate TEFCA, standardize CSP-based identity, and expand USCDI.\n    - Challenges: data fragmentation, lack of incentives, privacy concerns, and patient matching errors.\n  - **PC-9. What additional CMS data sources are valuable for the Blue Button 2.0 API?**\n    - Blue Button should evolve from a claims-only API to a longitudinal health data platform.\n    - Most valuable additions: real-time eligibility/benefits, prior authorization status, SDOH indicators, prescription drug formulary data, immunization records, and risk adjustment scores.\n    - Difficulties in access: data is scattered, held by MCOs not mandated to expose it, no standard authentication, and high data latency.\n    - To improve Blue Button: migrate to a fully FHIR-native architecture, enable real-time identity/consent via CSPs, include clinical/SDOH data, and standardize plan benefit data access.\n    - CMS should also partner with TEFCA QHINs to ingest and expose non-CMS data like lab results and pharmacy fills through Blue Button.\n  - **PC-10. How is TEFCA helping advance patient access?**\n    - TEFCA is operationalizing national data exchange through QHINs.\n    - At Health Gorilla (a QHIN), the Patient360 product has enabled patient-authorized access to longitudinal clinical histories.\n    - beHuman leverages this to pull records for cancer screening eligibility for underserved populations.\n    - Recommended changes to improve TEFCA:\n      - Mandate participation for all CMS-contracted payers, major labs, and certified EHRs.\n      - Enable patient-directed queries through certified third-party apps.\n      - Standardize digital identity workflows using CSPs.\n      - Embed TEFCA APIs into CMS Blue Button.\n    - There are no adequate alternatives to TEFCA's national governance and trust framework. Regional HIEs and private EHR networks are fragmented and proprietary.\n  - **PC-11. How are HIEs helping advance patient access?**\n    - HIEs provide critical regional infrastructure but data availability and accuracy vary widely.\n    - Recommended changes to improve HIE performance: standardize data formats (USCDI/FHIR), mandate bidirectional patient access via APIs, align HIEs with TEFCA participation, and require HIEs to adopt CSP-based identity verification.\n    - High-performing HIEs to replicate: CRISP (Maryland), IHIE (Indiana), and Manifest MedEx (California).\n    - In the TEFCA era, HIEs should evolve into regional data hubs that plug into the national framework, providing local depth and value-added services while supporting national reach.\n  - **PC-12. What are the most valuable operational health data use cases for patients/caregivers?**\n    - 1. Binding cost estimates for procedures.\n    - 2. Viewing real-time provider schedule availability across systems.\n    - 3. Third-party app integration for unified appointment management.\n    - 4. Access to provider-level, patient-facing quality metrics.\n    - 5. Intelligent provider search based on personalized needs (language, insurance, SDOH).\n    - To unlock these, CMS should mandate adoption of FHIR Scheduling APIs, incentivize price transparency APIs, and align participation through TEFCA and CSP-based identity.\n  - **PC-13. How can CMS encourage reporting of information blocking?**\n    - 1. Embed \"Report a Data Access Issue\" buttons directly into Medicare.gov and patient portals, pre-filling complaint forms.\n    - 2. Fund outreach and awareness campaigns, especially for underserved populations.\n    - 3. Allow trusted third parties (QHINs, apps) to assist in submitting reports with patient consent.\n    - 4. Improve the portal interface for accessibility and provide a complaint tracking dashboard.\n    - Increased reporting will drive accountability and highlight systemic non-compliance, ultimately advancing data exchange.\n  - **PC-14. Challenges and benefits of digital identity credentials (e.g., ID.me).**\n    - Challenges: low awareness, complex onboarding (especially for elderly/disabled users), and trust concerns.\n    - Benefits: seamless access to records with one login, secure proxy access for caregivers, and reduced fragmentation.\n    - Downsides: risk of widening the digital divide, privacy anxiety, and credential loss preventing access.\n    - CMS should mandate CSP acceptance for certified apps, provide grants for in-person identity verification, and bundle enrollment with Medicare registration to drive adoption.\n- **PROVIDERS (PR)**\n  - **PR-1. Encouraging providers to leverage digital health products.**\n    - CMS should tie adoption to reimbursement incentives (MIPS, ACOs), subsidize onboarding for small/rural practices, and create a certified directory of trusted digital tools.\n    - Obstacles: limited broadband, EHR vendor lock-in, workforce shortages, and lack of reimbursement for digital tool management.\n  - **PR-2. Obstacles to developing digital tools for physician workflows.**\n    - Key obstacles: lack of standardized data models/APIs, vendor lock-in, redundant manual quality reporting (QRDA), and insufficient real-time data access.\n    - Mitigation: Mandate open APIs (CDS Hooks, FHIR Scheduling), replace QRDA with FHIR-based reporting, and enable TEFCA access within workflow tools.\n  - **PR-3. Importance of accessing all EHR data formats.**\n    - Access to all data—including scanned documents, faxes, and free-text notes—is a clinical necessity, not a luxury.\n    - Lack of access leads to missed diagnoses, medication errors, and delayed treatment.\n    - CMS should mandate inclusion of scanned and free-text content in TEFCA exchange and incentivize vendors to implement OCR/NLP pipelines.\n  - **PR-4. Enabling third-party access to administrative workflows.**\n    - Most administrative functions (intake, scheduling) are locked in proprietary systems.\n    - CMS should expand API certification to mandate standardized FHIR APIs for scheduling, intake, and eligibility checks, available to third-party apps.\n    - TEFCA should be expanded to support the exchange of this administrative data.\n  - **PR-5. Supported FHIR APIs and capabilities at beHuman Corp.**\n    - beHuman uses a full suite of FHIR APIs built on a QHIN infrastructure for its AI-powered preventive care platform.\n    - This includes Patient Access, Population Services (Bulk FHIR), Provider Directory, Prior Authorization, SMART on FHIR, and CDS Hooks.\n    - The comment details the use case and constraints for each, highlighting that broader, mandated adoption would unlock greater efficiencies.\n  - **PR-6. TEFCA and provider access to health information.**\n    - TEFCA is starting to provide real value by allowing providers to query external sources in real time.\n    - Example: beHuman providers use TEFCA to retrieve complete clinical histories during intake for same-day screening decisions.\n    - To realize its full potential, CMS must mandate TEFCA participation for all contracted entities and require EHR vendors to embed TEFCA query capabilities natively into workflows.\n  - **PR-7. Strategies to reduce provider burden.**\n    - 1. Align interoperability with existing incentives (MIPS, APMs) instead of creating separate compliance tracks.\n    - 2. Fund plug-and-play tools and shared services (e.g., FHIR adapters, federated identity).\n    - 3. Expand technical assistance through regional TEFCA onboarding hubs.\n    - 4. Reduce redundancy by unifying data sharing programs (public health, quality, risk adjustment) around a single FHIR pipeline.\n  - **PR-8. Strategies to simplify clinical quality data responsibilities.**\n    - CMS should replace QRDA submissions with Bulk FHIR data exports from EHRs, allowing CMS to calculate metrics centrally.\n    - This reduces provider burden and improves consistency.\n    - CMS should unify interoperability and quality reporting by requiring certified data registries to support Bulk FHIR, provide real-time feedback dashboards, and connect to TEFCA.\n  - **PR-9. Encouraging provider acceptance of digital identity credentials.**\n    - Providers need help with integration toolkits, workflow redesign support, and financial incentives.\n    - CMS should fund EHR-vendor-neutral \"plug-and-play\" modules to integrate with CSPs (CLEAR, Login.gov, ID.me).\n    - Privacy can be balanced with convenience by using federated identity models and consent-first access.\n  - **PR-10. Digital identity credentials in provider workflows.**\n    - Challenges: integration complexity, cost for small practices, and patient onboarding friction.\n    - Benefits: improved authentication, streamlined proxy access, and enhanced compliance.\n    - Mandating CSP-based credentials would unify access to longitudinal records and strengthen trust in a nationwide provider directory by tying entries to verified identities.\n  - **PR-11. Role of trust communities (QHINs) in identity management.**\n    - TEFCA trust communities should evolve into identity and consent infrastructure providers, not just data routers.\n    - QHINs should support federated login via CSPs, issue reusable authorization tokens, and support verified proxy/caregiver workflows to reduce burden for everyone.\n  - **PR-12. Revising information blocking exceptions.**\n    - Yes, ASTP/ONC should revise and narrow the exceptions.\n    - Tighten the \"Infeasibility Exception\" by requiring objective evidence and a remediation plan.\n    - Refine the \"Security Exception\" to prevent its use as a generalized excuse to block API access.\n    - Introduce a new clause: \"Refusal to participate in TEFCA\" without legitimate justification should be considered constructive information blocking.\n  - **PR-13. Disincentives for providers without current penalties.**\n    - The most effective disincentives would combine financial, reputational, and operational levers.\n    - Tie participation in CMS payment programs (MIPS, ACOs) to interoperability compliance.\n    - Withhold or reduce CMS incentive payments for non-compliance.\n    - Publicly report non-compliant entities on an \"Interoperability Transparency Scorecard.\"\n  - **PR-14. Encouraging providers to submit information blocking complaints.**\n    - Embed a \"Report Information Blocking\" button into certified EHR workflows.\n    - Make reporting part of MIPS/TEFCA compliance.\n    - Protect reporters against retaliation and ensure anonymity.\n    - Increased reporting will surface invisible barriers and help target enforcement efforts.\n- **PAYERS (PA)**\n  - **PA-1. Policy or technical limitations in TEFCA.**\n    - The primary policy limitation is the voluntary participation model, especially for payers.\n    - CMS must require TEFCA participation for all CMS-contracted payers (MA, MCOs, QHPs).\n    - This should be tied to Star Ratings, quality bonuses, and network adequacy reviews.\n    - Without a mandate, payer participation will remain fragmented, undermining TEFCA's value.\n  - **PA-2. Encouraging payers to accelerate API implementation.**\n    - CMS should link FHIR API implementation and utilization directly to Star Ratings, HEDIS metrics, and network adequacy evaluations.\n    - CMS should also mandate FHIR R4 compliance, publicly benchmark API performance, and establish a centralized test harness for developers.\n  - **PA-3. Encouraging payers to accept digital identity credentials.**\n    - CMS should require the use of NIST-compliant CSPs (e.g., Login.gov, ID.me) as a condition for participation in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid Managed Care.\n    - This should be mandated in all beneficiary-facing portals and APIs.\n  - **PA-4. Value of a nationwide provider directory.**\n    - A directory with FHIR endpoints and digital identity would deliver significant value to payers by:\n      - Streamlining interoperability and accelerating data exchange.\n      - Improving referral routing and provider matching.\n      - Enhancing fraud prevention by linking listings to verified identities.\n      - Reducing network maintenance burden through auto-updates.\n  - **PA-5. Payers simplifying clinical quality data responsibilities.**\n    - Payers can reduce provider burden by using Bulk FHIR APIs to extract clinical data directly from EHRs and perform the quality calculations themselves.\n    - Interoperability and quality reporting can be consolidated by standardizing on Bulk FHIR and using shared digital quality registries that serve both CMS and commercial payers.\n  - **PA-7. Encouraging payers to submit information blocking complaints.**\n    - CMS should integrate complaint workflows into routine payer reporting mechanisms (e.g., interoperability attestations, prior auth audits).\n    - Increased payer reporting would improve data exchange by surfacing systemic barriers from EHR vendors or unresponsive providers.\n- **TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPERS (TD)**\n  - **TD-1. Stimulating developer interest.**\n    - CMS should launch an interoperability sandbox for developers to test apps against real-world standards (FHIR, TEFCA).\n    - This sandbox should include a public scoring dashboard and prioritize tools that serve underserved populations.\n  - **TD-2. Valuable CMS data for developers.**\n    - Most valuable additions: real-time lab results, imaging reports, ADT notifications, and prior authorization status via standardized CMS APIs.\n    - Most valuable alongside Blue Button 2.0: Clinical data via TEFCA, SDOH data, and home health/hospice records.\n  - **TD-3. Digital identity implementation.**\n    - Requiring NIST-compliant digital identity credentials would strengthen cybersecurity and enable real-time, cross-platform access under TEFCA.\n    - Mandating the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol would ensure compatibility across applications and accelerate developer adoption.\n  - **TD-4. Encouraging open, standards-based APIs.**\n    - Only certified open APIs should qualify for CMS programs. CMS should mandate their use in all accredited health IT products and link compliance to payment eligibility and quality bonuses.\n  - **TD-5. A nationwide provider directory of FHIR endpoints.**\n    - This is a critical utility. It should be published and maintained by CMS to ensure neutrality and should be free for users to access.\n  - **TD-6. Unique interoperability functions of TEFCA.**\n    - TEFCA provides a standardized legal/operational framework and a trusted QHIN structure for nationwide data sharing that no alternative can match. Redundant standards like Direct Messaging and proprietary APIs should be consolidated into TEFCA.\n  - **TD-7. USCDI's impact and limitations.**\n    - USCDI has advanced interoperability but does not yet include crucial elements like genomic data, PROs, or detailed SDOH. Expanding it would add value.\n  - **TD-8 & TD-9. Health IT certification.**\n    - Certification should prioritize API-enabled capabilities (FHIR, CDS Hooks, Bulk FHIR) over UI features. It must also require APIs to support exchanging all EHI, including unstructured data like faxes and notes.\n  - **TD-10 & TD-11. Cures Act API condition.**\n    - To meet the \"without special effort\" requirement, ONC should enforce API access to all EHI data elements (including unstructured) and conduct random audits. EHI export should be standardized on Bulk FHIR.\n  - **TD-12 & TD-13. Non-CMS data and full EHI access.**\n    - CMS should endorse TEFCA-aligned third-party data providers. APIs must support both standardized USCDI and complete EHI to balance standardization with comprehensiveness.\n  - **TD-14. Network's use of FHIR APIs (beHuman's experience).**\n    - beHuman's platform, via Health Gorilla's QHIN, connects to over 100,000 FHIR endpoints across all 50 states, including hospitals, labs, and pharmacies. Connections use a hybrid model of FHIR (g)(10), TEFCA/IHE, and private agreements.\n  - **TD-15 & TD-16. Bulk FHIR and network models.**\n    - Increased use of Bulk FHIR is critical for population health and VBC. Point-to-point connection models do not scale; shared network infrastructure like TEFCA must be the foundation.\n  - **TD-17. Ensuring viability of data sharing networks.**\n    - CMS should publish QHIN performance benchmarks, fund initial infrastructure, subsidize onboarding for small providers, and tie participation to value-based payment.\n  - **TD-18. Information blocking examples.**\n    - Experienced practices include vendors imposing exorbitant fees for standard FHIR APIs, artificial data throttling, and providers rejecting QHIN connections without justification.\n  - **TD-19. Price transparency implementation.**\n    - CMS should require machine-readable price data to be available in a standardized, API-accessible format to support shared decision-making and automated cost estimation.\n- **VALUE-BASED CARE (VB)**\n  - **VB-1. Incentives for APMs/ACOs to use digital health.**\n    - CMS should offer enhanced shared savings, upfront infrastructure payments, and performance bonuses for organizations that integrate certified digital tools.\n    - AI-based CDS tools integrated with TEFCA data have successfully flagged at-risk patients in pilot programs.\n  - **VB-2.

Essential health IT capabilities for VBC.**\n    - Equity dashboards utilizing TEFCA data should be incorporated into all models. Essential capabilities include real-time data aggregation, predictive analytics, and longitudinal records via TEFCA.\n  - **VB-4 & VB-5. Essential data types and certification criteria.**\n    - Critical data for VBC includes labs, ADTs, SDOH, imaging, and claims, all of which must be standardized for exchange through TEFCA.\n    - ONC certification must be strengthened to require TEFCA/QHIN integration and support for CDS Hooks.\n  - **VB-6. Unmet needs in certification.**\n    - Certification should be expanded to include care gap detection, real-time risk scoring, and integration with community-based organizations addressing SDOH. CMS should fund onboarding for FQHCs.\n  - **VB-7. Reducing complexity while preserving flexibility.**\n    - Use TEFCA analytics to evaluate engagement, outcomes, and equity. Standardize foundational APIs and data models but allow for tiered/modular certification for advanced features.\n  - **VB-8. Supplementing CEHRT requirements.**\n    - Tech infrastructure must be a reimbursable cost under VBC models. Barriers preventing APM participants from receiving ADT notifications (required for hospitals) must be removed by expanding notification requirements and funding integration.\n  - **VB-9 & VB-10. Technology requirements for APMs.**\n    - APM requirements should be higher, including TEFCA integration, Bulk FHIR access, and support for attribution logic. For smaller/rural providers, CMS should offer subsidies, allow use of shared infrastructure, and provide streamlined certification pathways.\n  - **VB-11. Interoperability challenges in VBC.**\n    - Key challenges are fragmented access to longitudinal data, inconsistent FHIR API use, missing ADT notifications, limited integration with SDOH providers, and lack of unified patient identity.\n  - **VB-12 & VB-13. Technology standardization and improvements.**\n    - Standardize foundational elements (FHIR APIs, common terminologies, digital identity, TEFCA) while allowing flexibility at the application layer. Improvements must focus on real-time data access, automated quality measurement, and enhanced SDOH standards.\n  - **VB-14. How digital identity improves VBC.**\n    - It enables seamless patient-centered data access, improves attribution and care coordination, enhances consent/proxy management, reduces administrative burden, and builds trust and equity.\n  - **VB-15. Value of a nationwide provider directory of FHIR endpoints.**\n    - It is a foundational asset for VBC, improving data access, strengthening claims data transparency, facilitating real-time coordination, and enabling smart routing for digital tools.

      "keyRecommendations": "- **Improve Digital Health Accessibility:** HHS should invest in health technology tools that work offline, via SMS, or in simple mobile formats for those without high-speed internet or smartphones, and provide digital literacy training for families, seniors, and caregivers.\n- **Enhance Support for Medicaid Patients:** Health technology systems must be designed to handle the complexities of Medically Needy Medicaid, clearly alerting patients when services or prescriptions are not covered and suggesting affordable or free alternatives.\n- **Integrate Holistic Care into Health Tech:** CMS should support the inclusion of features for tracking supplements, dietary needs (like for MTHFR), and other natural treatments in digital health tools, especially for chronic and complex conditions.\n- **Connect Health Tech to Social Determinants of Health:**\n  - Health platforms should be able to flag signs of housing instability (e.g., mold, eviction risk) and connect families to local services or legal aid.\n  - Providers should be alerted when a patient's living environment poses a health risk.\n- **Create Unified, User-Friendly Patient Portals:** Redesign patient portals to be as intuitive as a banking app, consolidating appointments, prescriptions, test results, and insurance coverage into one place with clear visuals and multilingual support.\n- **Reform Educational Support for Autistic Children:** Create ABA-based schools or structured autism programs with tiered levels to provide support based on individual student needs, as mainstream schools are often ill-equipped.",
      "mainConcerns": "- **Digital Divide:** Current health technology is inaccessible to low-income communities who lack high-speed internet, smartphones, or the technical knowledge to use complex platforms.\n- **Inadequate Support for Complex Medicaid Cases:** Health tech systems fail to account for the nuances of programs like Medically Needy Medicaid, leaving patients confused about coverage.\n- **Failure of Public Education for Autistic Children:** Public schools lack the training and resources to support autistic children, often misplacing them in inappropriate settings, which can lead to behavioral regression.\n  - The commenter's semi-verbal son was placed in a class with nonverbal students and developed new negative behaviors like biting and hitting.\n- **Pharma-Centric Health Platforms:** Digital health tools are overly focused on pharmaceuticals and completely ignore critical holistic, dietary, and supplemental care that is essential for conditions like MTHFR and autism.\n- **Systemic Blindness to Social Determinants:** The healthcare system and its technology fail to recognize and act on the direct link between health outcomes and factors like unsafe housing or risk of homelessness.\n- **Fragmented and Confusing Patient Portals:** Existing medical portals are difficult to navigate, making it hard for patients to manage their own care effectively.",

Within a year, he regressed significantly, picking up negative behaviors like biting, spitting, and hitting, which he had never exhibited before. This powerful anecdote illustrates how a lack of appropriate, tiered educational resources can actively harm a child's development.\n- **Connecting a Specific Genetic Condition to Health Tech Gaps:** The commenter notes their child has MTHFR, a genetic mutation requiring a specific diet. This is used as a concrete example of why health platforms must move beyond tracking just pharmaceuticals to include holistic data like diet and supplements.\n- **Framing Housing Instability as a Medical Alert:** The comment insightfully proposes that health tech should not just be a repository of medical data but should actively screen for social determinants of health, such as unsafe housing, and trigger alerts and connections to social services, treating it as a direct health risk.",

      "detailedContent": "- **Introduction**\n  - I am a parent of a child with autism and have navigated broken healthcare, education, and housing systems that fail to support families like mine.\n  - I want to share critical ways the health technology ecosystem could be improved to make a real difference.\n- **1. Digital Access Gaps in Underserved Communities**\n  - Digital health technology must work for everyone, especially people in low-income communities.\n  - These communities may not have high-speed internet, smartphones, or advanced tech knowledge.\n  - HHS should invest in tools that work offline, through SMS, or in simple mobile formats.\n  - Digital literacy training should be available for families, seniors, and caregivers.\n- **2. Support for Medicaid & Medically Needy Populations**\n  - Many families, including mine, depend on Medically Needy Medicaid.\n  - Health technology systems must reflect the complexity of these cases and not assume everyone has full coverage.\n  - The systems should clearly alert patients if services or prescriptions are not covered and offer affordable or free alternatives where possible.\n- **3. Better Educational Support for Autistic Children**\n  - There is a serious lack of help in public schools for children with autism.\n  - My son is semi-verbal and was placed in a classroom for completely nonverbal students with severe behavioral challenges.\n    - Within a year, he regressed, picking up negative behaviors like biting, spitting, and hitting, which he never did before.\n  - Teachers are overwhelmed and undertrained, often labeling autistic children as difficult instead of helping them succeed.\n  - I believe we need ABA-based schools or structured autism programs with tiered levels, so students get support based on their individual needs.\n  - Regular schools do not have the resources or structure to truly help children like my son thrive.\n- **4. Holistic and Dietary Support in Health Tech**\n  - My child also has MTHFR and needs a very specific diet.\n  - Current health platforms are too focused on pharmaceutical care and do not support tracking of supplements, natural treatments, or dietary needs.\n  - CMS should support the inclusion of holistic and integrative care in digital tools, especially for chronic conditions like Graves' disease, autism, or genetic sensitivities.\n- **5. Housing Instability as a Health Risk**\n  - Housing issues have a direct impact on health.\n  - Many families deal with unsafe living conditions (mold, no hot water) or are at risk of losing their homes, and this stress affects health.\n  - Health technology platforms should have the ability to flag signs of housing instability and connect families to local services or legal aid.\n  - Medical providers should be alerted when a patient's environment is putting their health at risk.\n- **6. Simplified and Unified Patient Portals**\n  - Most medical portals are hard to use and confusing.\n  - Patients should be able to easily see appointments, prescriptions, test results, and insurance coverage all in one place.\n  - The system should be as intuitive as a banking app, with clear visuals, notifications, and multilingual support.\n- **Closing**\n  - Real change can only happen when real people are heard, especially those raising children with special needs, navigating Medicaid, and dealing with systemic barriers daily.\n  - Please consider these ideas not as complaints, but as opportunities to build a more just and effective system for all."

      "commenterProfile": "- **Name/Organization:** Dock Health\n- **Type:** Business\n- **Role/Expertise:** Provider of clinical workflow, task management, and care coordination solutions. Founded by a pediatric gastroenterologist and informaticist. Expertise in reducing administrative burden and integrating AI into healthcare workflows.\n- **Geographic Scope:** National\n- **Stake in Issue:** As a vendor of workflow automation tools, their business model is directly impacted by regulations and incentives related to interoperability, administrative efficiency, and the adoption of digital health solutions in value-based care.",
      "corePosition": "We believe technology, particularly AI-augmented solutions, should be a catalyst for healthcare transformation by reducing the administrative burden that drives provider burnout and by enhancing care coordination. CMS can accelerate this by focusing on practical interoperability for real-world administrative and operational workflows, not just clinical data. We advocate for a human-AI collaboration model that combines AI's efficiency with the judgment and empathy of healthcare professionals.",
      "keyRecommendations": "- Mandate and enforce robust, standardized APIs (like FHIR) for all certified health IT, ensuring access to clinical, administrative, and operational data without prohibitive costs.\n- Create financial and non-financial incentives for adopting AI-augmented technologies that automate administrative tasks (e.g., prior authorizations, referral management) and demonstrably reduce provider burden.\n- Promote modular, \"best-of-breed\" systems to allow providers to plug in specialized applications, rather than being locked into monolithic EHRs.\n- Shift quality reporting to use Bulk FHIR data exports to CMS, with CMS taking on the responsibility of calculating the metrics to reduce provider burden.\n- Develop sustainable reimbursement models that recognize the value of digital health tools that improve efficiency and outcomes, not just those that facilitate a billable encounter.\n- In Alternative Payment Models (APMs), create specific financial incentives for demonstrated operational efficiency gains achieved through digital tools.\n- Provide developers with robust \"sandbox\" environments containing realistic, de-identified data to facilitate the development and testing of AI-augmented solutions.\n- Foster \"workflow interoperability\" where different systems can trigger actions in a shared, cross-organizational process.",

      "oneLineSummary": "A health informatics expert urges CMS to adopt advanced international standards like SNOMED CT, openEHR, and the International Patient Summary, all anchored by a national FHIR terminology server to overcome US interoperability deficits.",
      "commenterProfile": "- **Name/Organization:** David Rocha\n- **Type:** Individual\n- **Role/Expertise:** Health Informatics and Interoperability Standards Expert, with deep knowledge of FHIR, SNOMED CT, openEHR, TEFCA, USCDI, and international health data systems (e.g., Australia, Canada, UK).\n- **Geographic Scope:** National (US) with international comparisons.\n- **Stake in Issue:** An expert providing highly technical recommendations to improve the US national healthcare data infrastructure and align it with global best practices.",
      "corePosition": "The United States is years behind countries like Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands in semantic and structural interoperability. To catch up, CMS must drive the adoption of open standards like FHIR, SNOMED CT, and openEHR. The creation of a national FHIR terminology server and scaling the International Patient Summary (IPS) standard are critical infrastructure pieces needed to support truly patient-centric, longitudinal care.",
      "keyRecommendations": "- **Establish a National Terminology Service:**\n  - Create a national FHIR terminology server, similar to CSIRO's Ontoserver in Australia, to provide shared services for value set validation, code mapping, and terminology expansion.\n  - This server should support SNOMED CT's Expression Constraint Language (ECL) and the Value Set Compose Language (VSCL).\n  - Mandate that CMS contractors, HIEs, and QHINs use this national service to ensure semantic consistency.\n- **Adopt Advanced International Standards:**\n  - Scale the International Patient Summary (IPS) standard to create a \"Patient Summary for the United States (PS-US)\" for exchanging a core clinical snapshot via TEFCA.\n  - Promote and incentivize the use of openEHR for standardized clinical content models.\n  - Drive deeper integration of SNOMED CT, including its drug model and ECL, to enable more precise clinical queries and analytics.\n- **Enhance TEFCA and Data Exchange:**\n  - Formally define \"Care Coordination\" as a supported exchange purpose under TEFCA.\n  - Create a \"Track B\" affordability pathway for TEFCA, possibly using the OpenHIE framework, for rural, FQHC, and other under-resourced providers.\n  - Clarify and standardize the handling of sensitive behavioral health data (42 CFR Part 2) within TEFCA using FHIR security labels.\n- **Improve Data Accessibility and Structure:**\n  - Mandate extraction of structured data elements from imaging reports, moving away from reliance on PDFs.\n  - Expand USCDI+ to include prioritized data like Ejection Fraction (EF), FEV₁%, and structured concepts for \"Dangerous and harmful thoughts.\"\n  - Require the entire revenue cycle management process to be on FHIR, including EOBs and billing.\n- **Align Incentives with Interoperability Goals:**\n  - Tie Medicare Advantage, ACO, and other value-based care bonus payments and shared savings to the adoption and effective use of API-enabled CEHRT, FHIR standards, and PIQI compliance.\n  - Introduce financial disincentives, including recouping bonuses, for information blocking.\n- **Expand CMS API Offerings:**\n  - Create new families of CMS APIs for expenditures, ACO benchmarks, risk adjustment, utilization analytics, and Medicare Advantage data to spur innovation.\n- **Bolster Workforce and Provider Capabilities:**\n  - Launch a national upskilling and reskilling initiative for health IT professionals, backed by CMS and SDOs, offering credentials and CEU/CME credits for training in FHIR, SNOMED CT, and openEHR.\n  - Mandate that Care Delivery Organizations (CDOs), especially those affiliated with payers, adopt API-enabled CEHRT.",
      "mainConcerns": "- **US is Lagging in Interoperability:** The US is significantly behind international peers like Australia and Canada in implementing semantic and structural interoperability.\n- **Data is Inaccessible and Unstructured:** Critical health information is fragmented across provider portals, stuck in non-machine-readable formats like PDFs, or shared on physical media like CDs.\n- **Underutilization of Powerful Standards:** Advanced standards like SNOMED CT and openEHR are not being used to their full potential in the US, limiting clinical precision and data analysis.\n- **Excessive Provider Burden:** Current workflows, particularly for risk adjustment reporting, create an immense and time-consuming documentation burden for clinicians.\n- **Rural and Underserved Providers are Excluded:** The cost and complexity of frameworks like TEFCA risk leaving smaller, rural, and safety-net providers further behind.\n- **Post-Acute Care is an IT Desert:** Post-acute care providers (SNFs, home health, etc.) are essential to value-based care but are largely excluded from IT investment and modern data exchange.\n- **TEFCA Limitations:** TEFCA's roadmap to FHIR is too long, it over-relies on older standards like C-CDA, and it lacks explicit support for critical workflows like care coordination.",
      "notableExperiences": "- **The \"40 Diagnoses\" Anecdote:** A primary care physician had to document 40 distinct plans of care for a single new patient encounter to meet risk adjustment requirements, vividly illustrating the extreme administrative burden on clinicians.\n- **International Best Practices:** The commenter repeatedly cites specific, successful interoperability initiatives in other countries, such as Australia's national terminology server (Ontoserver) and Canada's use of the International Patient Summary, as concrete models for the US to follow.\n- **\"Track B\" for TEFCA:** Proposed a novel, two-track approach to national data exchange, with \"Track B\" leveraging the OpenHIE framework to create an affordable on-ramp for rural and safety-net providers who cannot afford full TEFCA participation.\n- **Blueprint for Structured Imaging Data:** Provided a highly detailed, specific list of the discrete data elements (e.g., tumor size in cm, location, margins, EF%) that should be extracted from imaging reports to make them computable, instead of being locked in PDFs.\n- **Grandchildren as Tech Support:** Noted the real-world challenge of digital identity adoption, where grandchildren are often the ones teaching their grandparents how to use services like ID.me.",
      "keyQuotations": "- \"If I was CMS, I would be meeting with the Australia Digital Health Agency, CSIRO, Canada Health Infoway, and Nictiz on how they implemented these data standards well. These organizations seem to be years ahead of CMS in terms of semantic and structural interoperability.\"\n- \"A primary care physician I am familiar with had to do 40 diagnosis on a new patient and write 40 distinct plans of care for that encounter.Today's workflows often rely on manual entry in EHRs, lack of semantic interoperability, and limited automation.\"\n- \"...the imaging studies are mostly PDFs- which to me is one of the biggest obstacles in healthcare. The lack of abstraction from PDFs is definitely affecting the healthcare system.\"\n- \"The below statement might be more controversial, but CMS and ASTP/ONC could recoup some of the prior year MSSP and Medicare advantage bonus payments if an insurance plan or ACO engaged in information blocking.\"",
      "detailedContent": "- **What health management or care navigation apps would help you understand and manage your health needs?**\n  - The next generation of apps should be built on open standards like FHIR, SNOMED CT, LOINC, openEHR, and align with USCDI+.\n  - To empower patients, apps should:\n    - Integrate data from all settings (primary care, specialty, behavioral health) via TEFCA, QHINs, and local HIEs for a unified view.\n    - Enable proactive care navigation using SNOMED CT-coded care plans, LOINC-coded labs, and FHIR Clinical Reasoning to suggest timely actions.\n    - Provide personalized insights through open clinical decision support (CDS) tools like CQL and FHIR CDS Hooks.\n    - Surface social and behavioral health needs using structured data (e.g., Gravity Project standards) to connect patients with community resources.\n    - Support family caregivers through privacy-aware data segmentation using FHIR.\n    - Interoperate with wearables and home monitoring devices using FHIR Observation and Device resources.\n  - To accelerate this, CMS could:\n    - Fund open-source prototype development.\n    - Partner with organizations like HL7 and The Sequoia Project for hackathons focused on priority populations.\n    - Promote alignment with USCDI+ domains.\n- **If I was CMS, I would be meeting with Australia, Canada, and Nictiz on how they implemented data standards well, as they seem years ahead.**\n- **If you had a personal assistant for health, what would you ask?**\n  - For chronic conditions (COPD, CHF, etc.), a digital assistant should:\n    - Track and alert on trends in key metrics like Ejection Fraction (EF) and FEV₁%, explaining changes in lay terms.\n    - Coordinate follow-up by triggering automated referrals (FHIR ServiceRequest).\n    - Surface data for shared care planning in a simple visual timeline, syncing with FHIR CarePlan resources.\n    - Integrate data from devices and imaging.\n    - Facilitate crisis prevention by combining indicators to predict and prevent ER visits.\n  - Policy Implication: CMS should promote EF and FEV₁% in USCDI+ and fund pilots for assistant-style tools using FHIR, SNOMED CT, and LOINC.\n- **Do you have easy access to your health information in one location?**\n  - No, information is siloed by provider, sometimes requiring separate Epic MyChart logins.\n  - Alliances like CARIN and demos by b.well and Commonwell are helpful in addressing this.\n- **What data types were unavailable or what are obstacles to access?**\n  - X-rays are viewed in PACS systems, and some imaging centers still issue CDs or USB drives.\n  - Imaging studies are mostly PDFs, a major obstacle due to the lack of data abstraction.\n  - It would help to have structured data elements for imaging findings, such as:\n    - Masses/Tumors: size, location, margins, enhancement pattern, number.\n    - Cardiothoracic: Ejection fraction, ventricular size, effusions.\n    - Pulmonary: Nodule characteristics, bronchiectasis, interstitial changes.\n    - Hepatic/Abdominal: Cirrhosis indicators, ascites, lesion characteristics.\n    - Neurological: Brain atrophy, white matter changes, hemorrhage.\n    - Spine/Bone: Compression fractures, metastatic lesions.\n    - Lymphadenopathy: Size, location, change over time.\n- **What features are missing from apps today?**\n  - Integration with SNOMED CT's Expression Constraint Language (ECL) and FHIR’s Value Set Compose Language (VSCL).\n  - ECL allows for dynamic definition of clinical concepts, reducing errors and maintenance burden.\n  - CMS should phase in ECL/VSCL adoption:\n    - Phase 1: Encourage voluntary use in FHIR APIs.\n    - Phase 2: Pilot in programs like US Core and ACO REACH.\n    - Phase 3: Require for CMS contractors.\n    - Phase 4: Mandate for new FHIR-based programs.\n  - ECL and VSCL would improve the PIQI framework by enabling precise cohort definition, multi-code system value sets, and automation.\n- **What apps should exist but do not yet?**\n  - Caregiver proxy access for managing multiple beneficiaries.\n  - Integrated SDOH and community services app.\n- **What workflows is CMS uniquely positioned to offer?**\n  - Transition of care notifications and post-acute follow-up workflows (e.g., SNF to home).\n  - FHIR workflow for annual wellness visits and preventive services.\n- **How can CMS encourage patient interest in digital health?**\n  - Digital literacy and training programs with partners like AARP and Area Agencies on Aging.\n- **Should CMS review/approve digital health products?**\n  - CMS could co-certify products with FTC/FDA or have its own certification level.\n  - Criteria could include clinical efficacy, interoperability, cost, and privacy.\n- **What changes can increase adoption of digital health products?**\n  - Reimbursement adjustments to reward providers and payers who support digital health tools.\n  - To enable timely access to high-quality data, it should be built on openEHR archetypes and fully integrated with SNOMED CT.\n- **What data is valuable but hard to access?**\n  - Observable entities data from SNOMED CT, like assessment scores (e.g., Glasgow coma score, COPD assessment test score), imaging observables, and function observables (e.g., activities of daily living).\n  - This would improve search queries in EHRs.\n  - The OMIM ontology for genomics is closed source, which affects research and AI development.\n- **What other data sources would be valuable?**\n  - For criminal justice/law enforcement: Data on \"Dangerous and harmful thoughts\" from SNOMED CT for USCDI+.\n  - For obesity: Consumer purchase data, public transit data, utility shut-off notices, eviction filings, and community organization data (e.g., missed Meals on Wheels visits).\n- **Opportunities and challenges for data integration for research:**\n  - Opportunities: Standardization on FHIR/SNOMED CT/LOINC, data aggregation platforms.\n  - Challenges: Data silos, privacy complexity, limited incentives for sharing.\n- **What additional data should be in the Blue Button 2.0 API?**\n  - Medicare Advantage (Part C) encounter data, SDOH data, risk adjustment data, care coordination/plan data, beneficiary survey data, and long-term services data.\n  - The lack of training on Blue Button integration within health systems is a major difficulty.\n- **How is TEFCA helping advance patient access?**\n  - Suggests a national terminology server API, similar to Australia's CSIRO model.\n  - RCE should learn from international best practices in terminology services, FHIR scaling, and SNOMED CT/openEHR integration.\n  - TEFCA's public health use case should incorporate SNOMED CT's ECL for querying (e.g., for mode of transmission).\n  - Use cases with significant impact if implemented via TEFCA:\n    - Formally defining \"Care Coordination\" as an exchange purpose.\n    - Implementing the International Patient Summary (IPS) US realm.\n- **What standards are not in wide use but could improve access?**\n  - SNOMED CT is not used to its full potential.\n  - openEHR is not used in the US.\n  - The International Patient Summary (IPS) could be scaled in the US to create a \"Patient Summary for the United States (PS-US).\"\n- **Should standards be consolidated?**\n  - CMS could create its own governing council on interoperability, similar to the Joint Initiative Council of SDOs.\n- **Are there alternatives to TEFCA for patient access?**\n  - CMS should consider a \"Track B\" using the OpenHIE framework for sectors that cannot afford TEFCA, like rural hospitals, FQHCs.\n- **How can HIEs advance patient access?**\n  - HIEs should be FHIR incubators, spearheading V2-to-FHIR and CDA-to-FHIR pilots.\n  - They should testbed US Core and USCDI+ implementations and use FHIR Subscription and Bulk Data.\n  - HIEs should have access to a CMS national terminology server. The UK and Australia provide national terminology services.\n- **How to encourage providers to leverage digital health?**\n  - Offer reimbursement bonuses and new CPT/HCPCS codes for digital health adoption in rural areas.\n  - Prioritize training for front-line staff in FQHCs and CAHs.\n  - Create a \"Digital Ready Rural Provider\" designation.\n- **Obstacles to development of innovative physician apps:**\n  - Proprietary EHRs, lack of standardized data models, regulatory burden, and change fatigue.\n  - An example of provider burden is risk adjustment reporting, where a physician had to write 40 distinct care plans for one new patient.\n  - NLP, SNOMED CT, and a starter library of care plan templates could automate and reduce this burden.\n- **How can CMS support providers in making data available?**\n  - Incentivize or mandate the use of federated terminology services for validation and mapping.\n- **How to simplify clinical quality data responsibilities?**\n  - Create a national terminology service (like Australia's Ontoserver) coordinated by ONC/CMS/NLM to support the PIQI framework.\n  - This would reduce duplication, support multiple use cases, and provide validation as a service within TEFCA.\n- **How to encourage providers to accept digital identity credentials?**\n  - The model for Electronic Prescription for Controlled Substances (EPCS) can be reused and applied to FHIR-based identity exchange.\n  - Incentivize adoption through bonus payments in managed care models.\n- **What policy limitations exist in TEFCA?**\n  - Long roadmap to FHIR, overreliance on C-CDA/IHE profiles, and lack of terminology services.\n  - Suggestions: Adopt a national terminology service, scale the International Patient Summary (IPS), and support openEHR adoption.\n- **How to encourage payers to accelerate API implementation?**\n  - Align FHIR implementation with Medicare Advantage star ratings and ACO bonus incentives.\n  - Provide grants or shared services for smaller payers.\n- **What are ways payers can simplify provider quality reporting?**\n  - Accept Bulk FHIR exports and use real-time FHIR subscriptions.\n  - Larger payers are using FHIR, but small/medium payers and life insurance companies offering Medigap plans are not. CMS should engage them.\n- **How can CMS stimulate developer interest?**\n  - More hackathons co-sponsored by large tech/AI companies and SDOs.\n  - Create new families of APIs for CMS data:\n    - Expenditure APIs, Attribution APIs, Quality Performance APIs, Financial APIs, Risk Adjustment APIs, Utilization Analytics APIs, Beneficiary Notification APIs, SDOH APIs, Care Coordination APIs, PRO APIs, and crucially, ACO Benchmarks APIs.\n    - Exposing ACO benchmark data via API would bolster innovation and competition.\n- **To what degree has USCDI improved interoperability?**\n  - It has provided a standardized core data set, but adoption can be minimal, and it has limited support for behavioral health and dental.\n  - It does not align with the IPS standard or openEHR archetypes.\n  - Adding a data element for \"Dangerous and harmful thoughts\" from SNOMED CT would add value for both healthcare and criminal justice.\n- **What incentives could encourage APMs to use digital health?**\n  - A portion of ACO shared savings could be based on interoperability engagement.\n  - An obstacle is the lack of collaboration between NAACOs and standards bodies like HL7 and SNOMED International.\n  - CMS should require payer-affiliated Care Delivery Organizations (CDOs) to adopt API-enabled CEHRT and mandate FHIR/CDA education for all staff, down to the front lines.\n- **How to integrate AI, pop health, etc., into APM requirements?**\n  - Integrate data usability and information quality (PIQI framework) into APM requirements.\n  - Use SNOMED CT's ECL for more precise risk stratification.\n  - CMS should create a coalition with leading AI companies and SDOs to scale genomics data integration.\n- **What are essential health IT capabilities for value-based care?**\n  - A national reskilling/upskilling initiative for health IT professionals, with credentialing and CEUs, is needed to build a competent workforce.\n  - State HIMSS chapters could lead this effort.\n  - Post-acute care providers are largely left out of IT investment and should be included in accelerators like the Gravity Project.\n- **Essential data types for value-based care:**\n  - ER visits, SNF stays, home health/hospice episodes, care plans, advance directives, and behavioral health data (e.g., PHQ-9 scores).\n  - CMS should collaborate with SNOMED International to create a HCPCS-to-SNOMED CT map to improve interoperability between claims and clinical data.\n- **Interoperability challenges in value-based care:**\n  - Lack of incentives to scale to full FHIR and SNOMED CT integration.\n  - Medication data exchange is hampered by a lack of adoption of the SNOMED CT Drug Model and IDMP standards.\n  - CMS should promote use of the SNOMED CT drug model and ECL querying in pharmacy workflows.\n- **How could a nationwide provider directory of FHIR endpoints help?**\n  - Key data elements should include supported FHIR capabilities (e.g., `$expand`, `$validate-code`), supported Implementation Guides, HIE/Payer network affiliations, and Bulk Data support."

      "oneLineSummary": "A medical device company proposes its secure, biometrically-controlled home pill dispenser to solve opioid misuse, non-adherence, and diversion by controlling access and monitoring patients remotely.",
      "commenterProfile": "- **Name/Organization:** iPill dispenser\n- **Type:** Business (Medical Device Manufacturer)\n- **Role/Expertise:** The commenter is the co-founder (John Hsu, MD) of a company that has developed an FDA Class II breakthrough designated product. Advisors mentioned include a former DEA Director and a former FDA Division Director.\n- **Geographic Scope:** National (United States)\n- **Stake in Issue:** As the creator of the iPill device, the company's success is directly tied to the adoption of technologies that address medication security and adherence in the home, particularly for controlled substances.",
      "corePosition": "The current regulatory framework for opioids creates a critical vulnerability by focusing on prescribers and pharmacies while ignoring the lack of security and oversight once medications are in a patient's home. This gap directly contributes to widespread medication non-adherence, abuse, diversion, and overdose. Our product, the iPill, is a technology-based solution that closes this gap by ensuring only the patient can access their medication at the correct time, monitoring adherence, and securely destroying unused pills.",
      "keyRecommendations": "- Integrate secure, smart home-dispensing technology into care models for high-risk populations.\n  - Make its use a mandatory part of early parole for individuals with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) being released from jail, to be paid for with opioid litigation settlement funds.\n  - Deploy the device within the Veterans Administration (VA) system to expand access to OUD treatment for the 418,000 veterans who currently cannot get care.\n  - Encourage adoption in OUD clinics to improve treatment retention, reduce provider liability, and increase patient capacity.\n  - Promote use for dispensing high-cost specialty and oncologic drugs to ensure adherence and provide objective data for insurers.\n  - Adopt in clinical research settings to enable decentralized trials and improve the accuracy of pharmacokinetic data.",
      "mainConcerns": "- **Lack of At-Home Controls:** While prescribers and pharmacies face extensive regulations, the patient has no rules or safeguards at home, allowing for easy misuse, diversion, and accidental overdose.\n- **Widespread Medication Non-Adherence:** 75% of patients do not take their prescribed medications correctly, resulting in an estimated 125,000 deaths and $290 billion in avoidable healthcare costs annually.\n- **Severe Barriers to OUD Treatment:** Only 11% of patients with OUD can access life-saving medications due to significant barriers, including lack of transportation, stigma, and geographic disparities.\n- **Extreme Risk for Post-Incarceration Population:** Individuals released from jail have a 129 times higher chance of overdose death in the two weeks following their release.\n- **Veteran Health Crisis:** An estimated 418,000 veterans need OUD treatment but cannot access it, contributing to a crisis where 44 veterans die each day from suicide and overdose.\n- **High Economic and Human Cost of Opioids:** In 2023, there were 110,000 opioid overdose deaths, costing the nation $2.7 trillion in medical expenses, unemployment, homelessness, and crime.",
      "notableExperiences": "- **Post-Incarceration Overdose Statistic:** The comment highlights a critical system failure by stating that individuals released from jail have a 129-times higher risk of overdose death in the first two weeks.\n- **OUD Clinic Pilot Study:** A 6-patient pilot study with Suboxone users demonstrated the system's effectiveness. It successfully detected two instances of missed doses, and alerts to family members resulted in the patients being reminded to take their medication. This provided a real-world example of the system's closed-loop remediation.\n- **Quantified Veteran Treatment Gap:** The comment specifies a vast care gap within the VA, where 208 OUD clinics treat only 6,500 veterans, leaving an estimated 418,000 who need treatment without access to it.\n- **Calculated Cost of Overdose:** The commenter calculates the cost per overdose death at $24.545 million by dividing the total estimated economic cost of the opioid crisis ($2.7 trillion) by the number of deaths in 2023 (110,000).",
      "keyQuotations": "- \"The end-user dispensing pharmacy and end-user prescribing physician have endless regulations to follow when prescribing opioids, but the final user patient has no rules or regulations at home and can easily misuse, divert, actually overdose on the opioid they are prescribed.\"\n- \"We can detect a daily missed dose and remediate it within hours instead of at the next pharmacy fill or physician appointment 30 days from now.\"\n- \"Detainees released from prison have a 129 higher chance of death in the 2 weeks after release.\"\n- \"44 veterans die a day from suicide or overdoses.\"",
      "detailedContent": "- The iPill is a medical device designed to prevent abuse, diversion, and accidental overdose while monitoring medication adherence in the home.\n- It has received an FDA Class II breakthrough designation.\n- The device allows access to pills only for the prescription holder at the scheduled time.\n- It can detect a missed daily dose and enable remediation within hours.\n- Unused pills are destroyed after 30 days or if the device is tampered with.\n- **Problem: Lack of Pill Security and Adherence in the Home**\n  - While prescribers and pharmacies are heavily regulated, patients at home have no safeguards.\n  - This leads to misuse, diversion, and overdose.\n  - 75% of patients don't take medications correctly, resulting in 125,000 deaths and $290 billion in extra healthcare costs annually.\n  - Opioid-specific issues:\n    - In 2023, 110,000 opioid overdose deaths cost the U.S. $2.7 trillion.\n    - Each overdose death costs an estimated $24.545 million.\n    - Medications that reduce opioid overdose deaths by 50% are only accessible to 11% of patients with OUD due to barriers like transportation, stigma, and health disparities.\n    - 86% of heroin addicts report first abusing prescription opioids as teens.\n    - Doctors fear prescribing opioids due to liability and the lack of safeguards to prevent patient misuse.\n- **Solution: The iPill Dispenser**\n  - The iPill system brings holistic care to patients via pill and patient monitoring.\n  - Key Features:\n    - Secure home delivery and storage.\n    - Biometric dispensing of medication only to the prescription holder at the prescribed time.\n    - Destruction of unused pills at 30 days or immediately if tampered with.\n    - Remote medication adherence monitoring to detect and remediate missed doses.\n    - Notification alerts sent to family, friends, and caregivers for missed doses.\n    - Data integration with Electronic Health Records (EHRs).\n    - Capture of vital signs via faceprint AI.\n    - Integrated psychosocial support via telehealth.\n- **Need: Specific High-Risk Populations**\n  - The iPill can dispense various medications, making it suitable for opioids, OUD medications, sedatives, stimulants, HIV drugs, and specialty/oncologic drugs.\n  - **Jail Population:**\n    - 65% of the jail population has OUD.\n    - Upon release, they face a 129x higher risk of overdose death, 75% higher risk of relapse and recidivism, and 50% chance of re-incarceration.\n    - Proposal: Make iPill a mandatory part of early parole, paid for by opioid settlement funds.\n  - **Veterans Administration (VA) Population:**\n    - 418,000 veterans need OUD treatment but cannot access it through the 208 existing VA clinics (which treat only 6,500 vets).\n    - This contributes to 44 veterans dying daily from suicide and overdose.\n    - Proposal: Use iPill to securely deliver medication and virtual care to veterans in their homes.\n- **Business and Implementation Model**\n  - The device would be paid for by entities like jails, OUD clinics, the VBA, specialty pharma, and contract research organizations (CROs), not patients or traditional insurance.\n  - **Jails:** A commercial pilot has been conducted. A potential market of 6.89 million individuals annually is identified.\n  - **OUD Clinics:** A 5-patient commercial pilot was completed successfully. The clinic is set to order more units.\n  - **Veterans Benefit Administration (VBA):** iPill is on the Advanced Procurement Portal and is awaiting production to begin. The target market is the 418,000 veterans needing treatment.\n  - **Specialty Pharma:** A group of 10 specialty pharma companies is ready to place an order once production begins. The device would ensure adherence for high-cost drugs (e.g., transplant, HIV, cancer).\n  - **CROs:** A commercial pilot is planned for 2025. The device would enable decentralized clinical trials and provide better data.\n- **Case Study: OUD Clinic Pilot**\n  - **Location:** Durham, North Carolina\n  - **Participants:** 6 patients on Suboxone SL 16mg twice a day.\n  - **Method:** Patients used a smartphone app to operate the dispenser via faceprint authentication. The system collected vital signs and a video of pill ingestion.\n  - **Results:**\n    - All patients successfully used the app and dispenser for 30 days.\n    - No tampering was noted.\n    - 2 patients forgot doses but were successfully reminded by family after receiving system-generated alerts.\n    - No ER visits or unscheduled provider interactions for withdrawal symptoms occurred.\n  - **Conclusion:** Biometric-secured home dispensing can ensure correct medication ingestion, prevent misuse, and provide objective adherence data for physicians.\n- **Workflow**\n  - A clinician prescribes medication every 30 days.\n  - The patient receives a prefilled dispenser from the pharmacy.\n  - The patient downloads the app and authenticates with a faceprint and government ID.\n  - To dispense a dose, the patient uses a faceprint and videotapes themselves taking the medication.\n  - The system sends real-time notifications to the care team. Missed doses trigger alerts to the patient, family, and caregivers for remediation.\n  - After 30 days, or if tampered with, unused pills are destroyed, and the dispenser is recycled/disposed of."

      "detailedContent": "- How can CMS evolve policy to meet the realities of modern healthcare delivery, particularly where digital infrastructure is no longer auxiliary, but foundational?\n- There is one clear opportunity: Reimburse Distributed Clinical Logic.\n- Across the system today, software (not people) is making real-time decisions that directly impact care, such as:\n  - Routing a patient from surgery to physical therapy\n  - Escalating behavioral risk based on pattern decompensation\n  - Titrating medication timing based on dynamic context\n  - Detecting social need and auto-triggering intervention\n- These are clinical decisions, not administrative workflows, executed with speed, consistency, and scalability no human can match.\n- Unfortunately, none of this is billable.\n  - Not under Fee-For-Service (FFS).\n  - Not under most Alternative Payment Models (APMs).\n  - Not under most value-based tech carveouts.\n- As a result, systems that think, coordinate, escalate, and guide care with clinical-grade intelligence are treated as cost centers.\n- This is not because they lack value, but because the reimbursement system doesn’t yet recognize intelligence as infrastructure.\n- I am proposing that it should.\n- What is Distributed Clinical Logic (DCL)?\n  - It’s a framework for understanding how real-time, rule-based or AI-enabled decision engines guide care delivery across the system.\n  - It operates everywhere care happens, not in one place.\n  - It acts as a persistent, embedded substrate of coordination, not through one person.\n  - It is:\n    - Deterministic when it needs to be\n    - Probabilistic when it must be\n    - Clinically governed always\n  - It doesn’t replace clinicians; it frees them from what doesn’t require their expertise so they can focus on where it does.\n  - It scales quality.\n- Why Now?\n  - This logic is already here, inside RPM dashboards, prior authorization platforms, population health tools, and care management engines.\n  - However, none of it is incentivized the right way.\n  - The opportunity cost of not acting is enormous.\n- I believe CMS could lead the industry in reframing this layer not as “tech,” not as “admin,” but as billable, clinical infrastructure.\n- This would be a subtle change in definition but would cause a massive shift in what becomes possible.\n- I have a proposed framework for how this model could work, including use cases, reimbursement structures, stakeholder benefits, and implementation tiers.\n- I welcome the opportunity to collaborate further.undefined"

      "oneLineSummary": "An individual with home health expertise argues that before promoting digital health, CMS must address the rural technology gap and drastically simplify the \"redundant and excessive\" OASIS documentation burden on providers.",
      "commenterProfile": "- **Name/Organization:** Susan Crandall\n- **Type:** Individual\n- **Role/Expertise:** Implicitly a Home Health professional, based on detailed comments on the OASIS assessment process.\n- **Geographic Scope:** Local/State (OR) with a focus on rural areas.\n- **Stake in Issue:** Directly impacted by the administrative burden of OASIS documentation and the practical challenges of providing care to patients with limited technology access.",
      "corePosition": "Before encouraging digital health products, CMS must recognize that many people in rural areas lack access to PCs or even cell coverage. Home health should be empowered to provide timely, quality skilled visits to these patients by reducing the massive amount of paperwork currently required in the OASIS documentation. The current assessment is redundant, excessive, and not meaningful for sharing with other providers.",
      "keyRecommendations": "- Drastically reduce the administrative burden of the Home Health OASIS assessment.\n  - The assessment should be simplified to include only meaningful data that is descriptive of the patient's condition, eliminating duplication.\n  - The current 110-question form is excessive, with only a few questions being truly useful.\n- Empower home health agencies to conduct more skilled visits for patients in rural areas who lack technology access, enabled by reduced paperwork.",
      "mainConcerns": "- A significant digital divide prevents the adoption of digital health tools in rural areas, where many patients lack PCs or reliable cell phone coverage.\n- Lack of interoperability between different provider EHR systems hinders access to complete patient medical histories, compromising continuity of care.\n- The current OASIS assessment is too burdensome and not clinically useful for data sharing.\n  - Sharing the full, unedited assessment would overwhelm physicians with redundant, non-meaningful information.\n- Increased data exchange and interoperability create the potential for HIPAA violations if patient consent is not properly managed.",
