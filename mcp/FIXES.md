# MCP Data Structure Fixes

This document summarizes all the fixes made to align the MCP implementation with the actual JSON structure generated by the build script.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. **Theme Structure**
- **Issue**: `Theme.children` was typed as `Theme[]` but actually contains `string[]` (theme codes)
- **Fixed**: Updated type definition and fixed `listThemes` handler to properly process child themes

### 2. **Comment Field Names**
- **Issue**: Code referenced `comment.postedDate` and `comment.condensed.wordCount`
- **Fixed**: Changed to `comment.date` and `comment.wordCount` to match actual structure

### 3. **DocketMeta Structure**
- **Issue**: Type had fields like `title`, `organization`, `commentCount` that don't exist
- **Fixed**: Updated to match actual structure with `documentId`, `generatedAt`, and nested `stats` object

### 4. **EntityTaxonomy Structure**
- **Issue**: Tests expected nested structure with categories array
- **Fixed**: Updated to simple object where keys are categories and values are entity arrays

### 5. **Theme Scores**
- **Issue**: Tests expected theme scores of 2-3, but actual data uses 1 to indicate presence
- **Fixed**: Updated test expectations to use value of 1

### 6. **Handler Updates**
- **listDockets**: Fixed to use correct DocketMeta fields
- **listThemes**: Fixed recursive processing of theme children
- **Example usage**: Updated all field accesses to match actual structure

## Key Data Structure Mappings

### Comment Structure
```typescript
{
  id: string,                    // Not commentId
  date: string,                  // Not postedDate
  wordCount: number,             // Not condensed.wordCount
  structuredSections: {          // Snake_case fields
    detailed_content: string,
    one_line_summary: string,
    // etc.
  }
}
```

### Theme Structure
```typescript
{
  code: string,
  description: string,           // Not name
  comment_count: number,         // Not commentCount
  children: string[]             // Array of codes, not Theme objects
}
```

### Entity Taxonomy
```typescript
{
  "Category Name": [             // Direct object, not nested structure
    { label, definition, terms, mentionCount }
  ]
}
```

## Testing
All tests have been updated and are passing. The MCP server correctly handles the actual JSON structure from the published website.

## Additional Enhancements

### 1. **Improved Search Snippets**
- Increased snippet context length from 100 to 800 characters (8x)
- Provides much better context for understanding matches

### 2. **Enhanced Response Structure**
All tools now return:
- **Docket metadata**: Total comments, themes, and entities
- **Contextual suggestions**: Smart follow-up queries based on results
- **Better organization**: Clearer structure with searchResults metadata

### 3. **Smart Defaults**
- `getComment` with no fields specified returns ALL fields (not just basic ones)
- `searchComments` with `returnType: "fields"` but no `returnFields` returns `detailedContent` by default
- This matches user expectations better

### 4. **Helpful Suggestions**
Each tool provides context-aware suggestions:
- Search results suggest pagination, field retrieval, theme/entity filtering
- Entity lists show most-mentioned entities
- Theme lists highlight most-discussed themes
- All suggestions include specific examples

### 5. **Documentation Updates**
- Clear notes about using full docket IDs
- Detailed parameter descriptions
- Examples of enhanced features

### 6. **Entity Handling Improvements**
- Entities are now excluded from default comment responses (too verbose)
- Entities are only included when explicitly requested via fields parameter
- This makes responses cleaner and more focused on actual content
- Entities remain available for searching/filtering with `entity:"Label"` syntax

### 7. **Theme Query Syntax**
- Fixed examples to use just theme codes (e.g., `theme:2.1`) 
- Removed theme titles from examples (was showing `theme:2.1 (Prior Authorization)`)
- Makes the query language cleaner and consistent

### 8. **Refined Suggestions**
- Removed low-yield suggestions about listThemes/listEntities
- Added better suggestion for switching from snippets to fields mode with detailedContent
- Focused on high-value next steps only

### 9. **Generic Entity Description**
- Made entity taxonomy description generic without specific examples
- Each docket has its own unique entities based on regulatory context
- LLMs can query listEntities to discover what's available

### 10. **Default to All Results**
- Changed default limit from 50 to all results (no limit)
- LLMs can specify a smaller limit if needed
- Prevents accidentally missing relevant comments
- Pagination suggestions only appear when limit is explicitly set
