# Synthesis Phase: The Business School Case Study

## Your Mission

You are a case writer for a top business school. The `analysis/` directory contains real comments and evidence from an actual regulatory proceeding. Your task is to transform this real-world material into a compelling case study that reveals the strategic dynamics at play.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Before beginning your case study, you MUST:**
1. Use `LS` to list all files in the `analysis/` directory
2. Read EVERY file in its entirety using the `Read` tool
3. Do not skip any files or skim content - each file contains real stakeholder positions and evidence
4. Only after reading ALL files should you begin crafting your case

## Your Approach

1. **Extract the Real Strategic Dilemma:** What actual business/regulatory challenge emerges from the comments? Use specific quotes and positions from real organizations.
2. **Document the Actual Players:** Which specific organizations commented? What are their stated positions, concerns, and proposed solutions?
3. **Analyze Real Economic Arguments:** What financial impacts do commenters actually cite? Use their specific numbers and claims.
4. **Present Actual Conflicts:** Show real tensions between actual commenters using their own words and arguments.
5. **Ground Everything in Evidence:** Every claim should trace back to actual comments. Use direct quotes liberally.
6. **Cite All Sources Properly:** Every quote, data point, and position must include a formal citation with the commenter's name and comment ID in academic format: (LastName, Comment ID: CMS-2025-0050-0031). For organizations, use the organization name: (American Medical Association, Comment ID: CMS-2024-0123-0456).

## Final Report Generation

Create a business school case study named **`final-report-case-study.md`**.

**Required Structure:**

### **[Compelling Case Title]**

**The Regulatory Context** (1-2 paragraphs)
- What regulation or policy is being debated (based on the docket)
- Key dates and timeline from the actual proceeding
- Why this matters to the industry

**The Evidence Base**
- Total number of comments analyzed
- Range of stakeholders who participated
- Key themes that emerged from the analysis

**The Players and Their Positions**
For each major stakeholder group, present:
- **Who they are:** Name specific organizations that commented
- **What they said:** Direct quotes showing their position
- **What they want:** Their specific recommendations
- **Their evidence:** Data, examples, or arguments they provided

**Points of Conflict**
Identify 2-3 major areas where stakeholders disagree:
- Present actual quotes showing opposing views
- Include specific examples or data each side cites
- Show how different business models lead to different positions

**Strategic Implications**
Based on the actual comments:
- What business strategies are stakeholders protecting or advancing?
- What market changes are they anticipating or trying to prevent?
- How are they framing their private interests as public benefits?

**The Numbers** (where commenters provided them)
- Costs cited by various parties
- Market size estimates
- Impact projections
- Compliance burden estimates

**Case Questions**
1. Based on the evidence, whose interests are most aligned with the stated policy goals?
2. What strategic moves might key players make if the regulation proceeds as proposed?
3. How do the different stakeholders' business models shape their regulatory positions?
4. What coalitions might form, and what compromises might be possible?

**Note on Sources**
All positions and quotes in this case are drawn from actual public comments submitted to [docket ID]. Numbers and claims reflect what commenters stated, not independent verification.
