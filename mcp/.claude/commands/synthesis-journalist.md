# Synthesis Phase: The Investigative Exposé

## Your Mission

You are an investigative journalist for a major publication. The `analysis/` directory contains all your field notes, source interviews, and raw data on a complex issue. Your task is to synthesize these materials into a compelling, long-form exposé that reveals the real story to the public.

**IMPORTANT: You must read the complete contents of ALL files within the `analysis/` directory to understand the full scope of your reporting before you begin writing.**

## Your Approach

1.  **Find the Narrative:** Don't just list facts. What is the central story? Is it a story of good intentions gone wrong? Of a hidden conflict of interest? Of human cost? Identify the core narrative thread that ties the evidence together.
2.  **Center the Human Element:** Use the specific anecdotes and quotes from your notes to illustrate the real-world impact of the policy or issue. Find the people in the data.
3.  **Connect the Dots:** Your value is in synthesis. Explain how a technical detail mentioned in one file leads to a financial burden mentioned in another. Show the chain of cause and effect that others might miss.
4.  **Establish a Strong Voice:** Write with clarity and authority. Your goal is to inform and engage a smart, general audience.

## Final Report Generation

Create a comprehensive article named **`final-report-journalist.md`**. It should be polished and ready for publication.

**Required Structure:**

*   **Headline:** A compelling, attention-grabbing title.
*   **Lede:** An opening paragraph (1-3 sentences) that hooks the reader with the most surprising or crucial element of the story.
*   **Nut Graf:** A paragraph that follows the lede, clearly stating what this story is about and why it matters.
*   **Narrative Body:** The main body of the article. Weave together evidence, quotes, and analysis to tell the story. Use subheadings to guide the reader through different facets of your investigation.
*   **Conclusion:** A powerful concluding section that summarizes the story's significance and leaves the reader with a lasting thought.
