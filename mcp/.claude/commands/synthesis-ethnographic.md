# Synthesis Phase: The Ethnographic Account

## Your Mission

You are an academic ethnographer documenting the lived experiences and ground-truth realities revealed in regulatory comments. The `analysis/` directory contains voices from the field - real people and organizations describing their actual experiences. Your task is to create a faithful account that lets these voices speak for themselves.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Before beginning your synthesis, you MUST:**
1. Use `LS` to list all files in the `analysis/` directory
2. Read EVERY file in its entirety using the `Read` tool
3. Do not skip any files - each contains unique experiences and perspectives
4. Only after reading ALL files should you begin your ethnographic account

## Your Approach

1. **Privilege Direct Testimony:** Let commenters speak in their own words through extensive block quotes
2. **Document Specific Experiences:** Focus on concrete examples, not abstract positions
3. **Preserve Emotional Truth:** Include language that conveys frustration, hope, fear, or urgency
4. **Show, Don't Summarize:** Use quotes to show patterns rather than making claims about them
5. **Stay Close to the Ground:** Resist the urge to abstract; keep returning to specific instances
6. **Attribute Every Voice:** Each quote must be properly attributed with the commenter's full name and comment ID to honor their contribution: "Quote text" - Dr. Jane Smith, Family Physician (Comment ID: CMS-2025-0050-0089). This ensures readers can trace each experience back to its source and respects the individuality of each voice

## Final Report Generation

Create an ethnographic account named **`final-report-ethnographic.md`**.

**Required Structure:**

### **[Title: Voices from the Field: [Topic] in Practice]**

**Introduction** (Brief)
- State the regulatory context
- Number of voices represented
- Your methodological commitment to direct testimony

**Part I: The Daily Reality**
Present 8-12 extended quotes showing day-to-day experiences:
```
"[Extended quote describing specific situation...]" 
- [Attribution, Role/Organization]

"[Another extended quote with concrete details...]"
- [Attribution, Role/Organization]
```

Between quotes, add minimal connective tissue (1-2 sentences max) to show themes emerging from the testimony itself.

**Part II: Critical Incidents**
Document 4-6 specific stories or examples that commenters shared:
- Lead with the full quote/story
- Note who shared it and their context
- Let the incident speak for itself

**Part III: The Language of Experience**
Group short quotes that show how people talk about key issues:

*On [Subtopic 1]:*
- "[Quote 1]" - [Attribution]
- "[Quote 2]" - [Attribution]
- "[Quote 3]" - [Attribution]

*On [Subtopic 2]:*
- "[Quote 1]" - [Attribution]
- "[Quote 2]" - [Attribution]

**Part IV: Convergences and Tensions**
Present quotes that show agreement:
```
Multiple voices echo similar experiences:
"[Quote 1]" - [Attribution]
"[Similar quote 2]" - [Attribution]
```

Then present quotes that show disagreement:
```
Yet experiences diverge significantly:
"[Contrasting quote 1]" - [Attribution]
"[Contrasting quote 2]" - [Attribution]
```

**Conclusion: What These Voices Reveal**
- 3-4 paragraphs maximum
- Draw only conclusions that emerge directly from quoted material
- End with a powerful quote that captures the stakes

**Methodological Note**
All quotes are verbatim from public comments submitted to [docket ID]. Ellipses indicate omitted text for length. No paraphrasing or interpretation has been added to the original language.
