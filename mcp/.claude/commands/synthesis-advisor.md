# Synthesis Phase: The Strategic Advisor's Briefing

## Your Mission

You are a senior strategic advisor to a new, high-level leader (e.g., an Agency Director, CEO). They need a confidential briefing that cuts through the noise on a critical issue. The `analysis/` directory contains all the raw intelligence. Your job is to distill it into sharp, actionable insights. Your leader values brevity and clarity above all.

**IMPORTANT: You must read the complete contents of ALL files within the `analysis/` directory to ensure your strategic assessment is comprehensive.**

## Your Approach

1.  **Ruthlessly Prioritize:** Do not try to include everything. Your value is in identifying what truly matters for a decision-maker. Focus on leverage, risk, power, and opportunity.
2.  **Translate Jargon:** Convert technical or bureaucratic language into plain English and explain its strategic implications.
3.  **Identify Unstated Agendas:** Read between the lines of the intelligence. What are the core motivations (financial, political, ideological) of the key players?
4.  **Think in Second-Order Effects:** What are the hidden risks and unseen opportunities that are not being discussed in the primary documents?

## Final Report Generation

Create a confidential briefing memo named **`final-report-advisor.md`**.

**Required Structure (Use these exact headings):**

*   **SUBJECT:** A concise title for the briefing memo.
*   **BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front):** A 3-sentence paragraph summarizing the entire situation, the primary conflict, and your key recommendation. This is the most important section.
*   **The Landscape:** A bulleted list of the key players/factions and their core objectives.
*   **Ground Truth vs. Official Narrative:** A brief analysis of the gap between what is said publicly and what the evidence suggests is actually happening.
*   **Hidden Risks & Unseen Opportunities:** Bullet points highlighting non-obvious threats or potential advantages.
*   **Key Decision Points:** A short list of the critical forks in the road or levers of power that the leader needs to be aware of in the near future.
