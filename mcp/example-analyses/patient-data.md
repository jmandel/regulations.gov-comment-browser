**SUBJECT:** Final Report on Patient Perspectives on Access to "All Their Data" (Analysis of RFI Comments CMS-2025-0050-0031)

### 1. Executive Summary

An analysis of over 125 comments submitted by individuals to the CMS RFI reveals a profound disconnect between the public's perception of CMS's data holdings and the fragmented reality of the healthcare ecosystem. Patients conceptualize "all their data" far more expansively than just the claims data CMS currently provides through Blue Button. Their definition encompasses a complete, longitudinal, and multi-modal record that includes everything from raw imaging files and genetic markers to caregiver observations and the right to correct inaccuracies. The most critical finding is the pervasive sense of powerlessness among patients, who report their data is aggregated and exchanged between institutions while they are left with siloed, incomplete, and often uncorrectable records. The call for access, therefore, is not merely for data retrieval, but for a fundamental rebalancing of control—a shift in data ownership from institutions to the individuals themselves.

### 2. Key Stakeholder Perspectives and Critical System Failures

While categorized as "Individuals," the commenters represent distinct stakeholder roles whose lived experiences reveal critical system failures. These perspectives are essential for understanding the human cost of data fragmentation.

#### **2.1. The Caregiver: The System's Invisible Infrastructure**

Caregivers—often family members providing unpaid, around-the-clock support—emerge as the human glue holding a broken system together. They perform the work of interoperability but are granted none of the access or authority.

*   **The "Invisible Data" Crisis:** AI strategist and caregiver [Teresa Younkin (CMS-2025-0050-0709)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0709) powerfully describes how the most crucial health indicators—"caregiver observations of daily functioning," "transportation barriers," and "subtle behavioral changes"—are "invisible data" that exist nowhere in any formal health record. These are the real drivers of outcomes, yet the system is blind to them.
*   **The Burden of Fragmentation:** [Karen Demerly (CMS-2025-0050-0209)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0209), whose parents suffered from dementia, recounts the impossible task of managing their care across multiple states and provider portals. She only learned of her mother's fatal pulmonary fibrosis when an ER doctor in Indiana asked about a diagnosis trapped in a Florida provider's system, long after her mother could recall it herself.

#### **2.2. The "Insider": The Expert Witness to a Broken System**

Some of the most searing indictments come from healthcare professionals and IT experts who are also navigating the system as patients or caregivers. They know how things *should* work, which makes the reality all the more horrifying.

*   **The Human Cost of Complexity:** A **[TBI survivor with 30 years of healthcare IT experience (CMS-2025-0050-0811)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0811)** provides a devastating account of how the system's complexity becomes a barrier to recovery. With cognitive capacity limited to just 45 minutes of focus twice a day, they found that over 75% of their "cognitively available time" was consumed simply by the administrative tasks of managing their care—a cruel paradox where the process of seeking health actively harms it.
*   **The Impotence of Expertise:** **[Linda Westenberger (CMS-2025-0050-0072)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0072)**, a Health Information Director with over 40 years of experience, notes that even with her professional knowledge, it was "quite a task" to gather and share her mother's records during transitions between a hospital, rehab, and an assisted living facility, where critical medication data was lost.

#### **2.3. The Powerless Patient: The Subject of an Uncorrectable Record**

The most fundamental failure reported by patients is the paradox of their data: it is about them, but it is not *theirs* to control or correct. This leads to permanent, life-altering consequences.

*   **The Uncorrectable Error:** **[Lewis Lewis (CMS-2025-0050-0861)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0861)**, a healthcare administrator, recounts being misdiagnosed with cancer by two major hospitals. That incorrect diagnosis is now permanently documented, impacting their ability to secure life and long-term care insurance. They have access to see the error but no power to fix it.
*   **The Two-Tiered System of Access:** The most critical system failure highlighted is that the infrastructure for unified data access *already exists*, but patients are deliberately excluded. An **[anonymous commenter (CMS-2025-0050-0352)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0352)** reveals that HIE systems provide instant, aggregated records to providers but are "designed to circumvent HIPAA" by "block[ing] patients from accessing them."

#### **2.4. The Privacy Advocate: The Guardian of Data Sovereignty**

A significant and vocal minority of commenters view the entire premise of data sharing with deep suspicion. Their perspective provides a crucial counter-narrative to the push for interoperability.

*   **Data as a Liability:** For these individuals, health data is not an asset to be leveraged but a threat to be contained. They oppose any mandatory digital IDs or biometric data collection. Their primary demand, echoed by commenters like **[Amy Harlib (CMS-2025-0050-0259)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0259)**, is the **"right to be forgotten"**—the absolute right to have their data deleted upon request, a capability that does not exist today.

### 3. Patient Perceptions of CMS Data Holdings vs. Reality

While patients look to CMS as a central authority, their comments reveal a deep-seated misunderstanding of what data the agency actually controls.

*   **The Medicare Advantage Gap:** Patients are acutely aware that CMS does not possess the granular encounter data from MA plans. [Max Doppelt (CMS-2025-0050-0971)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0971) explicitly identifies MA encounter data and prior authorizations as critical missing pieces that are "routinely captured but rarely delivered through standards-based APIs."
*   **The Siloed Government:** Experienced commenters like [David Rocha (CMS-2025-0050-0475)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0475) point out that even federal data is fragmented across agencies like the SSA, VA, and CDC.
*   **The Powerless Enforcer:** The harrowing experience of [Tim Moon (CMS-2025-0050-0188)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0188), a Parkinson's patient, demonstrates CMS's perceived inability to enforce its own rules when major health systems allegedly refuse to cooperate with state HIEs.
*   **The State vs. Federal Conflict:** Patients find their data access preferences overridden by state-level rules. [Ron Beats (CMS-2025-0050-0034)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0034) is forced to receive hundreds of pages of paper statements from his MA plan, which claims state mandates supersede his request for "DIGITAL access only."

In essence, patients believe CMS has the authority to solve data fragmentation, but their lived experiences prove that data is actually held captive by a patchwork of private insurers, non-compliant providers, and conflicting state regulations.

### 4. The Expansive Definition of "All Their Data": A Detailed Breakdown

Commenters define "all their data" not as a single file but as a dynamic, comprehensive, and controllable ecosystem of information. Access means more than just viewing; it means the power to use, correct, and share.

#### **4.1. The Complete, Unfiltered Clinical Record**
Patients demand an end to the "minimal information" they receive in portals. They want the same deep, unfiltered view as their providers.

*   **Raw Imaging Files:** Not just reports, but the actual DICOM images from CT scans and MRIs, which [Pamela Franks (CMS-2025-0050-0070)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0070) notes are often withheld or sold for a fee.
*   **Unfiltered Provider Notes & Data:** Access to the "detailed version" of visit notes, original EKG reports (not just vague conclusions), and the "reason for study" on imaging orders, as described by an [anonymous commenter (CMS-2025-0050-0266)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0266).
*   **Complete Longitudinal History:** A full record that follows them across states and providers, solving the problem faced by [Kate Bixler (CMS-2025-0050-0263)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0263), whose prenatal records were inaccessible when she was diverted to a different hospital in active labor.

#### **4.2. Data from the Entire Health Ecosystem**
"All their data" includes information currently trapped in disconnected, specialized silos.

*   **Pharmacy & Medication Data:** Pharmacogenomic (PGx) test results, prior authorization forms, and clinical notes to give pharmacists context, as advocated by [Kelee Petzelt (CMS-2025-0050-0757)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0757).
*   **Emergency & Pre-Hospital Data:** Life-saving information from ambulance crews—like POLST forms, mechanism of injury, and living conditions—which [Jonathon Feit (CMS-2025-0050-0660)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0660) calls "the big missing piece."
*   **Dental, Vision, and Behavioral Health Records:** Integration of these records so patients no longer have to be the "'go between,'" a term used by [Sarah Vander Beek (CMS-2025-0050-0520)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0520) regarding dental records.
*   **Genomic & Rare Disease Data:** Information from specialized research databases like OMIM, which [David Rocha (CMS-2025-0050-0900)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0900) points out is critical for precision medicine.

#### **4.3. Administrative and Financial Data**
Patients need this data to navigate the byzantine business of healthcare.

*   **Itemized Bills and Pricing:** The ability to see an itemized bill without waiting six months and to know procedure and medication costs upfront, a struggle detailed by [Lewis Lewis (CMS-2025-0050-0861)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0861).
*   **Insurance & Claims Data:** Full Medicare Advantage encounter data, prior authorization status, and all claims filed on their behalf.
*   **Advance Directives:** Portable, digital access to end-of-life care wishes, which are often trapped on paper or behind intellectual property barriers, as explained by [David Rocha (CMS-2025-0050-0349)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0349).

#### **4.4. "Invisible," Life-Context, and Patient-Generated Data**
This is the rich, real-world data that drives outcomes but is rarely recorded.

*   **Caregiver Observations:** The critical "invisible data" of "daily functioning" and "subtle behavioral changes" identified by [Teresa Younkin (CMS-2025-0050-0709)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0709).
*   **Home Monitoring & Wearable Data:** Vital signs from blood pressure cuffs, glucometers, and other devices, as envisioned by [Melissa Dehn (CMS-2025-0050-0244)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0244).
*   **Social & Environmental Data:** Information on housing conditions (e.g., mold), nutritional needs, and educational support, which the [parent of an autistic child (CMS-2025-0050-0047)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0047) argues is essential health data.

#### **4.5. Access as a Set of Rights and Capabilities**
For patients, "access" is not a passive verb. It is a set of powers to own and control their information.

*   **The Right to Correct and Co-Author:** The ability to fix errors and add their own notes, symptoms, and test results directly to the record, a right demanded by an [anonymous patient (CMS-2025-0050-0342)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0342) whose correction requests were repeatedly denied.
*   **The Right to Granular Control:** The power to grant and revoke access using smart contracts or other tools, as proposed by [Shannon Kennedy (CMS-2025-0050-0922)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0922).
*   **The Right to Audit:** Full transparency into who has accessed their data and when, a feature requested by [Robin Monks (CMS-2025-0050-0333)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0333).
*   **The Right to Understand:** Data must be presented with context, trends, and plain-language summaries so it can be acted upon, a need highlighted by [Brittany Crosby (CMS-2025-0050-0877)](https://joshuamandel.com/regulations.gov-comment-browser/CMS-2025-0050-0031/#/comments/CMS-2025-0050-0877).

### 5. Conclusion: A Mandate for Equality, Not Just Interoperability

The comments from individuals reveal a patient population that is increasingly sophisticated, frustrated, and demanding a fundamental shift in data control. They see a system where their data is used for billing, weaponized in negotiations, and aggregated for providers, all while they are denied access and the ability to ensure its accuracy.

The ultimate request is not just for CMS to provide "all its data." It is a demand for CMS to use its regulatory power to dismantle the existing two-tiered system. Patients know a comprehensive, unified view of their health information is not a futuristic dream; it is a present-day reality for their providers. "Access to all their data," in its most profound sense, means giving patients the exact same view and control that the institutions serving them already possess. The challenge for CMS is not merely technical interoperability, but addressing the fundamental power imbalance that profits from keeping patients in the dark.
